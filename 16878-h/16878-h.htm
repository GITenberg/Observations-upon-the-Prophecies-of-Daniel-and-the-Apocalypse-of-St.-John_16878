<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Introduction concerning the Compilers of
the books of the Old Testament.</i></p>

  <p>When <i>Manasses</i> <a name="NtpDanI_1"
  href="#NtDanI_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> set up a carved image in the house of
  the Lord, and built altars in the two courts of the house, to all the
  host of Heaven, and us'd inchantments and witchcraft, and familiar
  spirits, and for his great wickedness was invaded by the army of
  <i>Asserhadon</i> King of <i>Assyria</i>, and carried captive to
  <i>Babylon</i>; the book of the Law was lost till the eighteenth year of
  his grandson <i>Josiah</i>. Then <a name="NtpDanI_2"
  href="#NtDanI_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>Hilkiah</i> the High Priest, upon
  repairing the Temple, found it there: and the King lamented that their
  fathers had not done after the words of the book, and commanded that it
  should be read to the people, and caused the people to renew the holy
  covenant with God. This is the book of the Law now extant.</p>

  <p>When <a name="NtpDanI_3" href="#NtDanI_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  <i>Shishak</i> came out of <i>Egypt</i> and spoil'd the temple, and
  brought <i>Judah</i> into subjection to the monarchy of <i>Egypt</i>,
  (which was in the fifth year of <i>Rehoboam</i>) the <i>Jews</i>
  continued under great troubles for about twenty years; being <i>without
  the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without Law: and in
  those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came
  in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries,
  and nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city, for God did vex
  them with all adversity</i>. But <a name="NtpDanI_4"
  href="#NtDanI_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> when <i>Shishak</i> was dead, and
  <i>Egypt</i> fell into troubles, <i>Judah</i> had quiet ten years; and in
  that time <i>Asa</i> built fenced cities in <i>Judah</i>, and got up an
  army of 580000 men, with which, in the 15th year of his reign, he met and
  overcame <i>Zerah</i> the <i>Ethiopian</i>, who had conquered
  <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Lybia</i>, and <i>Troglodytica</i>, and came out with
  an army of 1000000 <i>Lybians</i> and <i>Ethiopians</i>, to recover the
  countries conquered by <i>Sesac</i>. And after this victory <a
  name="NtpDanI_5" href="#NtDanI_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> <i>Asa</i> dethroned
  his mother for idolatry, and he renewed the Altar, and brought new
  vessels of gold and silver into the Temple; and he and the people entered
  into a new covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers, upon pain of
  death to those who worshiped other Gods; and his son <i>Jehosaphat</i>
  took away the high places, and in the third year of his reign sent some
  of his Princes, and of the Priests and Levites, to teach in the cities of
  <i>Judah</i>: and they had the book of the Law with them, and went about
  throughout all the cities of <i>Judah</i>, and taught the people. This is
  that book of the Law which was afterwards lost in the reign of
  <i>Manasses</i>, and found again in the reign of <i>Josiah</i>, and
  therefore it was written before the third year of <i>Jehosaphat</i>.</p>

  <p>The same book of the Law was preserved and handed down to posterity by
  the <i>Samaritans</i>, and therefore was received by the ten Tribes
  before their captivity. For <a name="NtpDanI_6"
  href="#NtDanI_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> when the ten Tribes were captivated,
  a Priest or the captivity was sent back to <i>Bethel</i>, by order of the
  King of <i>Assyria</i>, to instruct the new inhabitants of
  <i>Samaria</i>, in <i>the manner of the God of the land</i>; and the
  <i>Samaritans</i> had the <i>Pentateuch</i> from this Priest, as
  containing the law or <i>manner of the God of the land</i>, which he was
  to teach them. For <a name="NtpDanI_7"
  href="#NtDanI_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> they persevered in the religion which
  he taught them, joining with it the worship of their own Gods; and by
  persevering in what they had been taught, they preserved this book of
  their Law in the original character of the <i>Hebrews</i>, while the two
  Tribes, after their return from <i>Babylon</i>, changed the character to
  that of the <i>Chaldees</i>, which they had learned at
  <i>Babylon</i>.</p>

  <p>And since the <i>Pentateuch</i> was received as the book of the Law,
  both by the two Tribes and by the ten Tribes, it follows that they
  received it before they became divided into two Kingdoms. For after the
  division, they received not laws from one another, but continued at
  variance. <i>Judah</i> could not reclaim <i>Israel</i> from the sin of
  <i>Jeroboam</i>, and <i>Israel</i> could not bring <i>Judah</i> to it.
  The <i>Pentateuch</i> therefore was the book of the Law in the days of
  <i>David</i> and <i>Solomon</i>. The affairs of the Tabernacle and Temple
  were ordered by <i>David</i> and <i>Solomon</i>, according to the Law of
  this book; and <i>David</i> in the 78th Psalm, admonishing the people to
  give ear to the Law of God, means the Law of this book. For in describing
  how their forefathers kept it not, he quotes many historical things out
  of the books of <i>Exodus</i> and <i>Numbers</i>.</p>

  <p>The race of the Kings of <i>Edom</i>, before there reigned any King
  over <i>Israel</i>, is set down in the book of <a name="NtpDanI_8"
  href="#NtDanI_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> <i>Genesis</i>; and therefore that
  book was not written entirely in the form now extant, before the reign of
  <i>Saul</i>. The writer set down the race of those Kings till his own
  time, and therefore wrote before <i>David</i> conquered <i>Edom</i>. The
  <i>Pentateuch</i> is composed of the Law and the history of God's people
  together; and the history hath been collected from several books, such as
  were the history of the Creation composed by <i>Moses</i>, <i>Gen</i>.
  ii. 4. the book of the generations of <i>Adam</i>, <i>Gen.</i> v. i. and
  the book of the wars of the Lord, <i>Num.</i> xxi. 14. This book of wars
  contained what was done at the Red-sea, and in the journeying of
  <i>Israel</i> thro' the Wilderness, and therefore was begun by
  <i>Moses</i>. And <i>Joshua</i> might carry it on to the conquest of
  <i>Canaan</i>. For <i>Joshua</i> wrote some things in the book of the Law
  of God, <i>Josh.</i> xxiv. 26 and therefore might write his own wars in
  the book of wars, those being the principal wars of God. These were
  publick books, and therefore not written without the authority of
  <i>Moses</i> and <i>Joshua</i>. And <i>Samuel</i> had leisure in the
  reign of <i>Saul</i>, to put them into the form of the books of
  <i>Moses</i> and <i>Joshua</i> now extant, inserting into the book of
  <i>Genesis</i>, the race of the Kings of <i>Edom</i>, until there reigned
  a King in <i>Israel</i>.</p>

  <p>The book of the <i>Judges</i> is a continued history of the
  <i>Judges</i> down to the death of <i>Sampson</i>, and therefore was
  compiled after his death, out of the Acts of the <i>Judges</i>. Several
  things in this book are said to be done <i>when there was no King in
  </i>Israel, <i>Judg.</i> xvii. 6. xviii. 1. xix. 1. xxi. 25. and
  therefore this book was written after the beginning of the reign of
  <i>Saul</i>. When it was written, the <i>Jebusites</i> dwelt in
  <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>Jud.</i> i. 21 and therefore it was written before
  the eighth year of <i>David</i>, 2 <i>Sam.</i> v. 8. and 1 <i>Chron.</i>
  xi. 6. The books of <i>Moses</i>, <i>Joshua</i>, and <i>Judges</i>,
  contain one continued history, down from the Creation to the death of
  <i>Sampson</i>. Where the <i>Pentateuch</i> ends, the book of
  <i>Joshua</i> begins; and where the book of <i>Joshua</i> ends, the book
  of <i>Judges</i> begins. Therefore all these books have been composed out
  of the writings of <i>Moses</i>, <i>Joshua</i>, and other records, by one
  and the same hand, after the beginning of the reign of <i>Saul</i>, and
  before the eighth year of <i>David</i>. And <i>Samuel</i> was a sacred
  writer, 1 <i>Sam.</i> x. 25. acquainted with the history of <i>Moses</i>
  and the <i>Judges</i>, 1 <i>Sam.</i> xii. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and had
  leisure in the reign of <i>Saul</i>, and sufficient authority to compose
  these books. He was a Prophet, and judged <i>Israel</i> all the days of
  his life, and was in the greatest esteem with the people; and the Law by
  which he was to judge the people was not to be published by less
  authority than his own, the Law-maker being not inferior to the judge.
  And the book of <i>Jasher</i>, which is quoted in the book of
  <i>Joshua</i>, <i>Josh.</i> x. 13. was in being at the death of
  <i>Saul</i>, 2 <i>Sam.</i> i. 18.</p>

  <p>At the dedication of the Temple of <i>Solomon</i>, when the Ark was
  brought into the most holy place, there was nothing in it but the two
  tables, 1 <i>Kings</i> viii. 9. and therefore when the <i>Philistines</i>
  took the Ark, they took out of it the book of the Law, and the golden pot
  of Manna, and <i>Aaron</i>'s Rod. And this and other losses in the
  desolation of <i>Israel</i>, by the conquering <i>Philistines</i>, might
  give occasion to <i>Samuel</i>, after some respite from those enemies, to
  recollect the scattered writings of <i>Moses</i> and <i>Joshua</i>, and
  the records of the Patriarchs and Judges, and compose them in the form
  now extant.</p>

  <p>The book of <i>Ruth</i> is a history of things done in the days of the
  <i>Judges</i>, and may be looked upon as an addition to the book of the
  <i>Judges</i>, written by the same author, and at the same time. For it
  was written after the birth of <i>David</i>, <i>Ruth</i> iv. 17, 22. and
  not long after, because the history of <i>Boaz</i> and <i>Ruth</i>, the
  great grandfather and great grandmother of <i>David</i>, and that of
  their contemporaries, could not well be remembered above two or three
  generations. And since this book derives the genealogy of <i>David</i>
  from <i>Boaz</i> and <i>Ruth</i>, and omits <i>David</i>'s elder brothers
  and his sons; it was written in honour of <i>David</i>, after he was
  anointed King by <i>Samuel</i>, and before he had children in
  <i>Hebron</i>, and by consequence in the reign of <i>Saul</i>. It
  proceeds not to the history of <i>David</i>, and therefore seems to have
  been written presently after he was anointed. They judge well therefore
  who ascribe to <i>Samuel</i> the books of <i>Joshua</i>, <i>Judges</i>,
  and <i>Ruth</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Samuel</i> is also reputed the author of the first book of
  <i>Samuel</i>, till the time of his death. The two books of <i>Samuel</i>
  cite no authors, and therefore seem to be originals. They begin with his
  genealogy, birth and education, and might be written partly in his
  lifetime by himself or his disciples the Prophets at <i>Naioth</i> in
  <i>Ramah</i>, 1 <i>Sam.</i> xix. 18, 19, 20. and partly after his death
  by the same disciples.</p>

  <p>The books of the <i>Kings</i> cite other authors, as the book of the
  Acts of <i>Solomon</i>, the book of the <i>Chronicles</i> of the Kings of
  <i>Israel</i>, and the book of the <i>Chronicles</i> of the Kings of
  <i>Judah</i>. The books of the <i>Chronicles</i> cite the book of
  <i>Samuel</i> the Seer, the book of <i>Nathan</i> the Prophet, and the
  book of <i>Gad</i> the Seer, for the Acts of <i>David</i>; the book of
  <i>Nathan</i> the Prophet, the Prophecy of <i>Ahijah</i> the
  <i>Shilonite</i>, and the visions of <i>Iddo</i> the Seer, for the Acts
  of <i>Solomon</i>; the book of <i>Shemajah</i> the Prophet, and the book
  of <i>Iddo</i> the Seer concerning genealogies, for the Acts of
  <i>Rehoboam</i> and <i>Abijah</i>; the book of the Kings of <i>Judah</i>
  and <i>Israel</i> for the Acts of <i>Asa</i>, <i>Joash</i>,
  <i>Amaziah</i>, <i>Jotham</i>, <i>Ahaz</i>, <i>Hezekiah</i>,
  <i>Manasseh</i>, and <i>Josiah</i>; the book of <i>Hanani</i> the Seer,
  for the Acts of <i>Jehosaphat</i>; and the visions of <i>Isaiah</i> for
  the Acts of <i>Uzziah</i> and <i>Hezekiah</i>. These books were therefore
  collected out of the historical writings of the antient Seers and
  Prophets. And because the books of the <i>Kings</i> and <i>Chronicles</i>
  quote one another, they were written at one and the same time. And this
  time was after the return from the <i>Babylonian</i> captivity, because
  they bring down the history of <i>Judah</i>, and the genealogies of the
  Kings of <i>Judah</i>, and of the High Priests, to that captivity. The
  book of <i>Ezra</i> was originally a part of the book of the
  <i>Chronicles</i>, and has been divided from it. For it begins with the
  two last verses of the books of <i>Chronicles</i>, and the first book of
  <i>Esdras</i> begins with the two last chapters thereof. <i>Ezra</i> was
  therefore the compiler of the books of <i>Kings</i> and
  <i>Chronicles</i>, and brought down the history to his own time. He was a
  ready Scribe in the Law of God; and for assisting him in this work
  <i>Nehemias</i> founded a library, and <i>gathered together the Acts of
  the Kings and the Prophets, and of </i>David<i>, and the Epistles of the
  Kings, concerning the holy gifts</i>, 2 <i>Maccab.</i> ii. 13. By the
  Acts of <i>David</i> I understand here the two books of <i>Samuel</i>, or
  at least the second book. Out of the Acts of the <i>Kings</i>, written
  from time to time by the Prophets, he compos'd the books of the Kings of
  <i>Judah</i> and <i>Israel</i>, the <i>Chronicles</i> of the Kings of
  <i>Judah</i>, and the <i>Chronicles</i> of the Kings of <i>Israel</i>.
  And in doing this he joined those Acts together, in due order of time,
  copying the very words of the authors, as is manifest from hence, that
  the books of the <i>Kings</i> and <i>Chronicles</i> frequently agree with
  one another in words for many sentences together. Where they agree in
  sense, there they agree in words also.</p>

  <p>So the Prophecies of <i>Isaiah</i>, written at several times, he has
  collected into one body. And the like he did for those of
  <i>Jeremiah</i>, and the rest of the Prophets, down to the days of the
  second Temple. The book of <i>Jonah</i> is the history of <i>Jonah</i>
  written by another hand. The book of <i>Daniel</i> is a collection of
  papers written at several times. The six last chapters contain Prophecies
  written at several times by <i>Daniel</i> himself: the six first are a
  collection of historical papers written by others. The fourth chapter is
  a decree of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>. The first chapter was written after
  <i>Daniel</i>'s death: for the author saith, that <i>Daniel</i> continued
  to the first year of <i>Cyrus</i>; that is, to his first year over the
  <i>Persians</i> and <i>Medes</i>, and third year over <i>Babylon</i>.
  And, for the same reason, the fifth and sixth chapters were also written
  after his death. For they end with these words: <i>So this </i>Daniel<i>
  prospered in the reign of </i>Darius<i> and in the reign of </i>Cyrus<i>
  the</i> Persian. Yet these words might be added by the collector of the
  papers, whom I take to be <i>Ezra</i>.</p>

  <p>The Psalms composed by <i>Moses</i>, <i>David</i>, and others, seem to
  have been also collected by <i>Ezra</i> into one volume. I reckon him the
  collector, because in this collection I meet with Psalms as late as the
  <i>Babylonian</i> captivity, but with none later.</p>

  <p>After these things <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i> spoiled the Temple,
  commanded the <i>Jews</i> to forsake the Law upon pain of death, and
  caused the sacred books to be burnt wherever they could be found: and in
  these troubles the book of the <i>Chronicles</i> of the Kings of
  <i>Israel</i> was entirely lost. But upon recovering from this
  oppression, <i>Judas Maccabæus</i> gathered together all those writings
  that were to be met with, 2 <i>Maccab.</i> ii. 14. and in reducing them
  into order, part of the Prophecies of <i>Isaiah</i>, or some other
  Prophet, have been added to the end of the Prophecies of
  <i>Zechariah</i>; and the book of <i>Ezra</i> has been separated from the
  book of <i>Chronicles</i>, and set together in two different orders; in
  one order in the book of <i>Ezra</i>, received into the Canon, and in
  another order in the first book of <i>Esdras</i>.</p>

  <p>After the <i>Roman</i> captivity, the <i>Jews</i> for preserving their
  traditions, put them in writing in their <i>Talmud</i>, and for
  preserving their scriptures, agreed upon an Edition, and pointed it, and
  counted the letters of every sort in every book: and by preserving only
  this Edition, the antienter various lections, except what can be
  discovered by means of the <i>Septuagint</i> Version, are now lost; and
  such marginal notes, or other corruptions, as by the errors of the
  transcribers, before this Edition was made, had crept into the text, are
  now scarce to be corrected.</p>

  <p>The <i>Jews</i> before the <i>Roman</i> captivity, distinguished the
  sacred books into the Law, the Prophets, and the <i>Hagiographa</i>, or
  holy writings; and read only the Law and the Prophets in their
  Synagogues. And Christ and his Apostles laid the stress of religion upon
  the Law and the Prophets, <i>Matt.</i> vii. 12. xxii. 4. <i>Luke</i> xvi.
  16, 29, 31. xxiv. 44. <i>Acts</i> xxiv. 14. xxvi. 22. <i>Rom.</i> iii.
  21. By the <i>Hagiographa</i> they meant the historical books called
  <i>Joshua</i>, <i>Judges</i>, <i>Ruth</i>, <i>Samuel</i>, <i>Kings</i>,
  <i>Chronicles</i>, <i>Ezra</i>, <i>Nehemiah</i>, and <i>Esther</i>, the
  book of <i>Job</i>, the <i>Psalms</i>, the books of <i>Solomon</i>, and
  the <i>Lamentations</i>. The Samaritans read only the <i>Pentateuch</i>:
  and when <i>Jehosaphat</i> sent men to teach in the cities, they had with
  them only the book of the Law; for the Prophecies now extant were not
  then written. And upon the return from the <i>Babylonian</i> captivity,
  <i>Ezra</i> read only the book of the Law to the people, from morning to
  noon on the first day of the seventh month; and from day to day in the
  feast of Tabernacles: for he had not yet collected the writings of the
  Prophets into the volume now extant; but instituted the reading of them
  after the collection was made. By reading the Law and the Prophets in the
  Synagogues, those books have been kept freer from corruption than the
  <i>Hagiographa</i>.</p>

  <p>In the infancy of the nation of <i>Israel</i>, when God had given them
  a Law, and made a covenant with them to be their God if they would keep
  his commandments, he sent Prophets to reclaim them, as often as they
  revolted to the worship of other Gods: and upon their returning to him,
  they sometimes renewed the covenant which they had broken. These Prophets
  he continued to send, till the days of <i>Ezra</i>: but after their
  Prophecies were read in the Synagogues, those Prophecies were thought
  sufficient. For if the people would not hear <i>Moses</i> and the old
  Prophets, they would hear no new ones, no not <i>tho they should rise
  from the dead</i>. At length when a new truth was to be preached to the
  <i>Gentiles</i>, namely, <i>that Jesus was the Christ</i>, God sent new
  Prophets and Teachers: but after their writings were also received and
  read in the Synagogues of the Christians, Prophecy ceased a second time.
  We have <i>Moses</i>, the Prophets, and Apostles, and the words of Christ
  himself; and if we will not hear them, we shall be more inexcusable than
  the <i>Jews.</i> For the Prophets and Apostles have foretold, that as
  <i>Israel</i> often revolted and brake the covenant, and upon repentance
  renewed it; so there should be a falling away among the Christians, soon
  after the days of the Apostles; and that in the latter days God would
  destroy the impenitent revolters, and make a new covenant with his
  people. And the giving ear to the Prophets is a fundamental character of
  the true Church. For God has so ordered the Prophecies, that in the
  latter days <i>the wise may understand, but the wicked shall do wickedly,
  and none of the wicked shall understand</i>, Dan. xii. 9, 10. The
  authority of Emperors, Kings, and Princes, is human. The authority of
  Councils, Synods, Bishops, and Presbyters, is human. The authority of the
  Prophets is divine, and comprehends the sum of religion, reckoning
  <i>Moses</i> and the Apostles among the Prophets; and <i>if an Angel from
  Heaven preach any other gospel</i>, than what they have delivered, <i>let
  him be accursed</i>. Their writings contain the covenant between God and
  his people, with instructions for keeping this covenant; instances of
  God's judgments upon them that break it: and predictions of things to
  come. While the people of God keep the covenant, they continue to be his
  people: when they break it they cease to be his people or church, and
  become <i>the Synagogue of Satan, who say they are </i>Jews<i> and are
  not.</i> And no power on earth is authorized to alter this covenant.</p>

  <p>The predictions of things to come relate to the state of the Church in
  all ages: and amongst the old Prophets, <i>Daniel</i> is most distinct in
  order of time, and easiest to be understood: and therefore in those
  things which relate to the last times, he must be made the key to the
  rest.</p>

<h3><a name="DanII">CHAP. II</a>.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the Prophetic Language.</i></p>

  <p>For understanding the Prophecies, we are, in the first place, to
  acquaint our-selves with the figurative language of the Prophets. This
  language is taken from the analogy between the world natural, and an
  empire or kingdom considered as a world politic.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the whole world natural consisting of heaven and earth,
  signifies the whole world politic, consisting of thrones and people, or
  so much of it as is considered in the Prophecy: and the things in that
  world signify the analogous things in this. For the heavens, and the
  things therein, signify thrones and dignities, and those who enjoy them;
  and the earth, with the things thereon, the inferior people; and the
  lowest parts of the earth, called <i>Hades</i> or Hell, the lowest or
  most miserable part of them. Whence ascending towards heaven, and
  descending to the earth, are put for rising and falling in power and
  honour: rising out of the earth, or waters, and falling into them, for
  the rising up to any dignity or dominion, out of the inferior state of
  the people, or falling down from the same into that inferior state;
  descending into the lower parts of the earth, for descending to a very
  low and unhappy estate; speaking with a faint voice out of the dust, for
  being in a weak and low condition; moving from one place to another, for
  translation from one office, dignity, or dominion, to another; great
  earthquakes, and the shaking of heaven and earth, for the shaking of
  kingdoms, so as to distract or overthrow them; the creating a new heaven
  and earth, and the passing away of an old one, or the beginning and end
  of the world, for the rise and ruin of the body politic signified
  thereby.</p>

  <p>In the heavens, the Sun and Moon are, by interpreters of dreams, put
  for the persons of Kings and Queens; but in sacred Prophecy, which
  regards not single persons, the Sun is put for the whole species and race
  of Kings, in the kingdom or kingdoms of the world politic, shining with
  regal power and glory; the Moon for the body of the common people,
  considered as the King's wife; the Stars for subordinate Princes and
  great men, or for Bishops and Rulers of the people of God, when the Sun
  is Christ; light for the glory, truth, and knowledge, wherewith great and
  good men shine and illuminate others; darkness for obscurity of
  condition, and for error, blindness and ignorance; darkning, smiting, or
  setting of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, for the ceasing of a kingdom, or for
  the desolation thereof, proportional to the darkness; darkning the Sun,
  turning the Moon into blood, and falling of the Stars, for the same; new
  Moons, for the return of a dispersed people into a body politic or
  ecclesiastic.</p>

  <p>Fire and meteors refer to both heaven and earth, and signify as
  follows; burning any thing with fire, is put for the consuming thereof by
  war; a conflagration of the earth, or turning a country into a lake of
  fire, for the consumption of a kingdom by war; the being in a furnace,
  for the being in slavery under another nation; the ascending up of the
  smoke of any burning thing for ever and ever, for the continuation of a
  conquered people under the misery of perpetual subjection and slavery;
  the scorching heat of the sun, for vexatious wars, persecutions and
  troubles inflicted by the King; riding on the clouds, for reigning over
  much people; covering the sun with a cloud, or with smoke, for oppression
  of the King by the armies of an enemy; tempestuous winds, or the motion
  of clouds, for wars; thunder, or the voice of a cloud, for the voice of a
  multitude; a storm of thunder, lightning, hail, and overflowing rain, for
  a tempest of war descending from the heavens and clouds politic, on the
  heads of their enemies; rain, if not immoderate, and dew, and living
  water, for the graces and doctrines of the Spirit; and the defect of
  rain, for spiritual barrenness.</p>

  <p>In the earth, the dry land and congregated waters, as a sea, a river,
  a flood, are put for the people of several regions, nations, and
  dominions; embittering of waters, for great affliction of the people by
  war and persecution; turning things into blood, for the mystical death of
  bodies politic, that is, for their dissolution; the overflowing of a sea
  or river, for the invasion of the earth politic, by the people of the
  waters; drying up of waters, for the conquest of their regions by the
  earth; fountains of waters for cities, the permanent heads of rivers
  politic; mountains and islands, for the cities of the earth and sea
  politic, with the territories and dominions belonging to those cities;
  dens and rocks of mountains, for the temples of cities; the hiding of men
  in those dens and rocks, for the shutting up of Idols in their temples;
  houses and ships, for families, assemblies, and towns, in the earth and
  sea politic; and a navy of ships of war, for an army of that kingdom that
  is signified by the sea.</p>

  <p>Animals also and vegetables are put for the people of several regions
  and conditions; and particularly, trees, herbs, and land animals, for the
  people of the earth politic: flags, reeds, and fishes, for those of the
  waters politic; birds and insects, for those of the politic heaven and
  earth; a forest for a kingdom; and a wilderness for a desolate and thin
  people.</p>

  <p>If the world politic, considered in prophecy, consists of many
  kingdoms, they are represented by as many parts of the world natural; as
  the noblest by the celestial frame, and then the Moon and Clouds are put
  for the common people; the less noble, by the earth, sea, and rivers, and
  by the animals or vegetables, or buildings therein; and then the greater
  and more powerful animals and taller trees, are put for Kings, Princes,
  and Nobles. And because the whole kingdom is the body politic of the
  King, therefore the Sun, or a Tree, or a Beast, or Bird, or a Man,
  whereby the King is represented, is put in a large signification for the
  whole kingdom; and several animals, as a Lion, a Bear, a Leopard, a Goat,
  according to their qualities, are put for several kingdoms and bodies
  politic; and sacrificing of beasts, for slaughtering and conquering of
  kingdoms; and friendship between beasts, for peace between kingdoms. Yet
  sometimes vegetables and animals are, by certain epithets or
  circumstances, extended to other significations; as a Tree, when called
  the <i>tree of life</i> or <i>of knowledge</i>; and a Beast, when called
  <i>the old serpent</i>, or worshipped.</p>

  <p>When a Beast or Man is put for a kingdom, his parts and qualities are
  put for the analogous parts and qualities of the kingdom; as the head of
  a Beast, for the great men who precede and govern; the tail for the
  inferior people, who follow and are governed; the heads, if more than
  one, for the number of capital parts, or dynasties, or dominions in the
  kingdom, whether collateral or successive, with respect to the civil
  government; the horns on any head, for the number of kingdoms in that
  head, with respect to military power; seeing for understanding, and the
  eyes for men of understanding and policy, and in matters of religion for
  <span lang="el" title="Episkopoi"
  >&#x395;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>,
  Bishops; speaking, for making laws; the mouth, for a law-giver, whether
  civil or sacred; the loudness of the voice, for might and power; the
  faintness thereof, for weakness; eating and drinking, for acquiring what
  is signified by the things eaten and drank; the hairs of a beast, or man,
  and the feathers of a bird, for people; the wings, for the number of
  kingdoms represented by the beast; the arm of a man, for his power, or
  for any people wherein his strength and power consists; his feet, for the
  lowest of the people, or for the latter end of the kingdom; the feet,
  nails, and teeth of beasts of prey, for armies and squadrons of armies;
  the bones, for strength, and for fortified places; the flesh, for riches
  and possessions; and the days of their acting, for years; and when a tree
  is put for a kingdom, its branches, leaves and fruit, signify as do the
  wings, feathers, and food of a bird or beast.</p>

  <p>When a man is taken in a mystical sense, his qualities are often
  signified by his actions, and by the circumstances of things about him.
  So a Ruler is signified by his riding on a beast; a Warrior and
  Conqueror, by his having a sword and bow; a potent man, by his gigantic
  stature; a Judge, by weights and measures; a sentence of absolution, or
  condemnation, by a white or a black stone; a new dignity, by a new name;
  moral or civil qualifications, by garments; honour and glory, by splendid
  apparel; royal dignity, by purple or scarlet, or by a crown;
  righteousness, by white and clean robes; wickedness, by spotted and
  filthy garments; affliction, mourning, and humiliation, by clothing in
  sackcloth; dishonour, shame, and want of good works, by nakedness; error
  and misery, by drinking a cup of his or her wine that causeth it;
  propagating any religion for gain, by exercising traffick and merchandize
  with that people whose religion it is; worshipping or serving the false
  Gods of any nation, by committing adultery with their princes, or by
  worshipping them; a Council of a kingdom, by its image; idolatry, by
  blasphemy; overthrow in war, by a wound of man or beast; a durable plague
  of war, by a sore and pain; the affliction or persecution which a people
  suffers in labouring to bring forth a new kingdom, by the pain of a woman
  in labour to bring forth a man-child; the dissolution of a body politic
  or ecclesiastic, by the death of a man or beast; and the revival of a
  dissolved dominion, by the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<h3><a name="DanIII">CHAP. III</a>.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the vision of the Image composed of four Metals.</i></p>

  <p>The Prophecies of <i>Daniel</i> are all of them related to one
  another, as if they were but several parts of one general Prophecy, given
  at several times. The first is the easiest to be understood, and every
  following Prophecy adds something new to the former. The first was given
  in a dream to <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, King of <i>Babylon</i>, in the
  second year of his reign; but the King forgetting his dream, it was given
  again to <i>Daniel</i> in a dream, and by him revealed to the King. And
  thereby, <i>Daniel</i> presently became famous for wisdom, and revealing
  of secrets: insomuch that <i>Ezekiel</i> his contemporary, in the
  nineteenth year of <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, spake thus of him to the King
  of <i>Tyre</i>: <i>Behold</i>, saith he, <i>thou art wiser than
  </i>Daniel<i>, there is no secret that they can hide from thee</i>, Ezek.
  xxviii. 3. And the same <i>Ezekiel</i>, in another place, joins
  <i>Daniel</i> with <i>Noah</i> and <i>Job</i>, as most high in the favour
  of God, <i>Ezek.</i> xiv. 14, 16, 18, 20. And in the last year of
  <i>Belshazzar</i>, the Queen-mother said of him to the King: <i>Behold
  there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods;
  and in the days of thy father, light and understanding and wisdom, like
  the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king
  </i>Nebuchadnezzar<i> thy father, the king, I say, thy father made master
  of the magicians, astrologers, </i>Chaldeans<i> and soothsayers:
  forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding,
  interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of
  doubts, were found in the same </i>Daniel<i>, whom the king named
  </i>Belteshazzar, Dan. v. 11, 12. <i>Daniel</i> was in the greatest
  credit amongst the <i>Jews</i>, till the reign of the <i>Roman</i>
  Emperor <i>Hadrian</i>: and to reject his Prophecies, is to reject the
  Christian religion. For this religion is founded upon his Prophecy
  concerning the <i>Messiah</i>.</p>

  <p>Now in this vision of the Image composed of four Metals, the
  foundation of all <i>Daniel</i>'s Prophecies is laid. It represents a
  body of four great nations, which should reign over the earth
  successively, <i>viz.</i> the people of <i>Babylonia</i>, the
  <i>Persians</i>, the <i>Greeks</i>, and the <i>Romans</i>. And by a stone
  cut out without hands, which fell upon the feet of the Image, and brake
  all the four Metals to pieces, and <i>became a great mountain, and filled
  the whole earth</i>; it further represents that a new kingdom should
  arise, after the four, and conquer all those nations, and grow very
  great, and last to the end of all ages.</p>

  <p>The head of the Image was of gold, and signifies the nations of
  <i>Babylonia</i>, who reigned first, as <i>Daniel</i> himself interprets.
  <i>Thou art this head of gold</i>, saith he to <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.
  These nations reigned till <i>Cyrus</i> conquered <i>Babylon</i>, and
  within a few months after that conquest revolted to the <i>Persians</i>,
  and set them up above the <i>Medes</i>. The breast and arms of the Image
  were of silver, and represent the <i>Persians</i> who reigned next. The
  belly and thighs of the Image were of brass, and represent the
  <i>Greeks</i>, who, under the dominion of <i>Alexander</i> the great,
  conquered the <i>Persians</i>, and reigned next after them. The legs were
  of iron, and represent the <i>Romans</i> who reigned next after the
  <i>Greeks</i>, and began to conquer them in the eighth year of
  <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i>. For in that year they conquered
  <i>Perseus</i> King of <i>Macedon</i>, the fundamental kingdom of the
  <i>Greeks</i>; and from thence forward grew into a mighty empire, and
  reigned with great power till the days of <i>Theodosius</i> the great.
  Then by the incursion of many northern nations, they brake into many
  smaller kingdoms, which are represented by the feet and toes of the
  Image, composed part of iron, and part of clay. For then, saith
  <i>Daniel</i>, <a name="NtpDanIII_1"
  href="#NtDanIII_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <i>the kingdom shall be divided,
  and there shall be in it of the strength of iron, but they shall not
  cleave one to another.</i></p>

  <p><i>And in the days of these Kings</i>, saith <i>Daniel</i>, <i>shall
  the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and
  the kingdom shall not be left to other people; but it shall break in
  pieces, and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
  Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountains
  without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay,
  the silver and the gold.</i></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the vision of the four Beasts.</i></p>

  <p>In the next vision, which is of the four Beasts, the Prophecy of the
  four Empires is repeated, with several new additions; such as are the two
  wings of the Lion, the three ribs in the mouth of the Bear, the four
  wings and four heads of the Leopard, the eleven horns of the fourth
  Beast, and the son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven, to the Antient
  of Days sitting in judgment.</p>

  <p>The first Beast was like a lion, and had eagle's wings, to denote the
  kingdoms of <i>Babylonia</i> and <i>Media</i>, which overthrew the
  <i>Assyrian</i> Empire, and divided it between them, and thereby became
  considerable, and grew into great Empires. In the former Prophecy, the
  Empire of <i>Babylonia</i> was represented by the head of gold; in this
  both Empires are represented together by the two wings of the lion.
  <i>And I beheld,</i> saith <a name="NtpDanIV_1"
  href="#NtDanIV_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <i>Daniel</i>, <i>till the wings
  thereof were pluckt, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to
  stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it</i>; that
  is, till it was humbled and subdued, and made to know its human
  state.</p>

  <p>The second Beast was like a bear, and represents the Empire which
  reigned next after the <i>Babylonians</i>, that is, the Empire of the
  <i>Persians</i>. <i>Thy kingdom is divided</i>, or broken, saith
  <i>Daniel</i> to the last King of <i>Babylon</i>, <i>and given to the
  </i>Medes<i> and </i>Persians, <i>Dan.</i> v. 28. This Beast <i>raised
  itself up on one side</i>; the <i>Persians</i> being under the
  <i>Medes</i> at the fall of <i>Babylon</i>, but presently rising up above
  them. <a name="NtpDanIV_2" href="#NtDanIV_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>And it
  had three ribs in the mouth of it, between the teeth of it</i>, to
  signify the kingdoms of <i>Sardes</i>, <i>Babylon</i>, and <i>Egypt</i>,
  which were conquered by it, but did not belong to its proper body. And it
  devoured much flesh, the riches of those three kingdoms.</p>

  <p>The third Beast was the kingdom which succeeded the <i>Persian</i>;
  and this was the empire of the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>Dan.</i> viii. 6, 7, 20,
  21. It was <i>like a Leopard</i>, to signify its fierceness; and had four
  heads and four wings, to signify that it should become divided into four
  kingdoms, <i>Dan.</i> viii 22. for it continued in a monarchical form
  during the reign of <i>Alexander</i> the great, and his brother
  <i>Aridæus</i>, and young sons <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Hercules</i>; and
  then brake into four kingdoms, by the governors of provinces putting
  crowns on their own heads, and by mutual consent reigning over their
  provinces. <i>Cassander</i> reigned over <i>Macedon</i>, <i>Greece</i>,
  and <i>Epirus</i>; <i>Lysimachus</i> over <i>Thrace</i> and
  <i>Bithynia</i>; <i>Ptolemy</i> over <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Lybia</i>,
  <i>Arabia</i>, <i>C&#339;losyria</i>, and <i>Palestine</i>; and
  <i>Seleucus</i> over <i>Syria</i>.</p>

  <p>The fourth Beast was the empire which succeeded that of the
  <i>Greeks</i>, and this was the <i>Roman</i>. This beast was exceeding
  dreadful and terrible, and had great iron teeth, and devoured and brake
  in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and such was the
  <i>Roman</i> empire. It was larger, stronger, and more formidable and
  lasting than any of the former. It conquered the kingdom of
  <i>Macedon</i>, with <i>Illyricum</i> and <i>Epirus</i>, in the eighth
  year of <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i>. 580; and
  inherited that of <i>Pergamus</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 615; and
  conquered that of <i>Syria</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 679, and that of
  <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 718. And by these and other conquests
  it became greater and more terrible than any of the three former Beasts.
  This Empire continued in its greatness till the reign of
  <i>Theodosius</i> the great; and then brake into ten kingdoms,
  represented by the ten horns of this Beast; and continued in a broken
  form, till the Antient of days sat in a throne like fiery flame, and
  <i>the judgment was set, and the books were opened, and the Beast was
  slain and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flames; and one
  like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the
  Antient of days</i> <a name="NtpDanIV_3"
  href="#NtDanIV_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, and received dominion over all
  nations, and judgment was given to the saints of the most high, and the
  time came that they possessed the kingdom.</p>

  <p><i>I beheld,</i> saith <a name="NtpDanIV_4"
  href="#NtDanIV_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <i>Daniel</i>, <i>till the Beast was
  slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flames. As
  concerning the rest of the Beasts, they had their dominion taken away:
  yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time</i>. And therefore
  all the four Beasts are still alive, tho the dominion of the three first
  be taken away. The nations of <i>Chaldea</i> and <i>Assyria</i> are still
  the first Beast. Those of <i>Media</i> and <i>Persia</i> are still the
  second Beast. Those of <i>Macedon</i>, <i>Greece</i> and <i>Thrace</i>,
  <i>Asia</i> minor, <i>Syria</i> and <i>Egypt</i>, are still the third.
  And those of <i>Europe</i>, on this side <i>Greece</i>, are still the
  fourth. Seeing therefore the body of the third Beast is confined to the
  nations on this side the river <i>Euphrates</i>, and the body of the
  fourth Beast is confined to the nations on this side <i>Greece</i>; we
  are to look for all the four heads of the third Beast, among the nations
  on this side of the river <i>Euphrates</i>; and for all the eleven horns
  of the fourth Beast, among the nations on this side of <i>Greece</i>. And
  therefore, at the breaking of the <i>Greek</i> empire into four kingdoms
  of the <i>Greeks</i>, we include no part of the <i>Chaldeans</i>,
  <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i> in those kingdoms, because they belonged
  to the bodies of the two first Beasts. Nor do we reckon the <i>Greek</i>
  empire seated at <i>Constantinople</i>, among the horns of the fourth
  Beast, because it belonged to the body of the third.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the Kingdoms represented by the
feet of the Image composed of iron and clay.</i></p>

  <p><i>Dacia</i> was a large country bounded on the south by the
  <i>Danube</i>, on the east by the <i>Euxine</i> sea, on the north by the
  river <i>Neister</i> and the mountain <i>Crapac</i>, and on the west by
  the river <i>Tibesis</i>, or <i>Teys</i>, which runs southward into the
  <i>Danube</i> a little above <i>Belgrade</i>. It comprehended the
  countries now called <i>Transylvania</i>, <i>Moldavia</i>, and
  <i>Wallachia</i>, and the eastern part of the upper <i>Hungary</i>. Its
  antient inhabitants were called <i>Getæ</i> by the <i>Greeks</i>,
  <i>Daci</i> by the <i>Latins</i>, and <i>Goths</i> by themselves.
  <i>Alexander</i> the great attacked them, and <i>Trajan</i> conquered
  them, and reduced their country into a Province of the <i>Roman</i>
  Empire: and thereby the propagation of the Gospel among them was much
  promoted. They were composed of several <i>Gothic</i> nations, called
  <i>Ostrogoths</i>, <i>Visigoths</i>, <i>Vandals</i>, <i>Gepides</i>,
  <i>Lombards</i>, <i>Burgundians</i>, <i>Alans</i>, &amp;c. who all agreed
  in their manners, and spake the same language, as <i>Procopius</i>
  represents. While they lived under the <i>Romans</i>, the <i>Goths</i> or
  <i>Ostrogoths</i> were seated in the eastern parts of <i>Dacia</i>, the
  <i>Vandals</i> in the western part upon the river <i>Teys</i>, where the
  rivers <i>Maresh</i> and <i>Keresh</i> run into it. The <i>Visigoths</i>
  were between them. The <i>Gepides</i>, according to <i>Jornandes</i>,
  were upon the <i>Vistula</i>. The <i>Burgundians</i>, a <i>Vandalic</i>
  nation, were between the <i>Vistula</i> and the southern fountain of the
  <i>Boristhenes</i>, at some distance from the mountain <i>Crapac</i>
  northwards, where <i>Ptolemy</i> places them, by the names of
  <i>Phrugundiones</i> and <i>Burgiones</i>.<a name="NtpDanV_1"
  href="#NtDanV_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The <i>Alans</i>, another
  <i>Gothic</i> nation, were between the northern fountain of the
  <i>Boristhenes</i> and the mouth of the river <i>Tanais</i>, where
  <i>Ptolemy</i> placeth the mountain <i>Alanus</i>, and western side of
  the <i>Palus Mæotis</i>.</p>

  <p>These nations continued under the dominion of the <i>Romans</i> till
  the second year of the Emperor <i>Philip</i>, and then for want of their
  military pay began to revolt; the <i>Ostrogoths</i> setting up a kingdom,
  which, under their Kings <i>Ostrogotha</i>, <i>Cniva</i>, <i>Araric</i>,
  <i>Geperic</i>, and <i>Hermanaric</i>, increased till the year of Christ
  376; and then by an incursion of the <i>Huns</i> from beyond the
  <i>Tanais</i>, and the death of <i>Hermanaric</i>, brake into several
  smaller kingdoms. <i>Hunnimund</i>, the son of <i>Hermanaric</i>, became
  King over the <i>Ostrogoths</i>; <i>Fridigern</i> over the
  <i>Visigoths</i>; <i>Winithar</i>, or <i>Vinithar</i>, over a part of the
  <i>Goths</i> called <i>Gruthungi</i> by <i>Ammian</i>, <i>Gothunni</i> by
  <i>Claudian</i>, and <i>Sarmatæ</i> and <i>Scythians</i> by others:
  <i>Athanaric</i> reign'd over another part of the <i>Goths</i> in
  <i>Dacia</i>, called <i>Thervingi</i>; <i>Box</i> over the <i>Antes</i>
  in <i>Sarmatia</i>; and the <i>Gepides</i> had also their King. The
  <i>Vandals</i> fled over the <i>Danube</i> from <i>Geberic</i> in the
  latter end of the reign of <i>Constantine</i> the great, and had seats
  granted them in <i>Pannonia</i> by that Emperor, where they lived quietly
  forty years, <i>viz.</i> till the year 377, when several <i>Gothic</i>
  nations flying from the <i>Hunns</i> came over the <i>Danube</i>, and had
  seats granted them in <i>Mæsia</i> and <i>Thrace</i> by the <i>Greek</i>
  Emperor <i>Valens</i>. But the next year they revolted, called in some
  <i>Goths</i>, <i>Alans</i> and <i>Hunns</i>, from beyond the
  <i>Danube</i>, and routed the <i>Roman</i> army, slew the Emperor
  <i>Valens</i>, and spread themselves into <i>Greece</i> and
  <i>Pannonia</i> as far as the <i>Alps</i>. In the years 379 and 380 they
  were checkt by the arms of the Emperors <i>Gratian</i> and
  <i>Theodosius</i>, and made a submissive peace; the <i>Visigoths</i> and
  <i>Thervingi</i> returned to their seats in <i>Mæsia</i> and
  <i>Thrace</i>, the <i>Hunns</i> retired over the <i>Danube</i>, and the
  <i>Alans</i> and <i>Gruthingi</i> obtained seats in <i>Pannonia</i>.</p>

  <p>About the year 373, or 374, the <i>Burgundians</i> rose from their
  seats upon the <i>Vistula</i>, with an army of eighty thousand men to
  invade <i>Gallia</i>; and being opposed, seated themselves upon the
  northern side of the <i>Rhine</i> over against <i>Mentz</i>. In the year
  358, a body of the <i>Salian Franks</i>, with their King, coming from the
  river <i>Sala</i>, were received into the Empire by the Emperor
  <i>Julian</i>, and seated in <i>Gallia</i> between <i>Brabant</i> and the
  <i>Rhine</i>: and their King <i>Mellobaudes</i> was made <i>Comes
  domesticorum</i>, by the Emperor <i>Gratian</i>. <i>Richomer</i>, another
  noble <i>Salian Frank</i>, was made <i>Comes domesticorum</i>, and
  <i>Magister utriusque Militiæ</i>, by <i>Theodosius</i>; and A.C. 384,
  was Consul with <i>Clearchus</i>. He was a great favourite of
  <i>Theodosius</i>, and accompanied him in his wars against
  <i>Eugenius</i>, but died in the expedition, and left a son called
  <i>Theudomir</i>, who afterwards became King of the <i>Salian Franks</i>
  in <i>Brabant</i>. In the time of this war some <i>Franks</i> from beyond
  the <i>Rhine</i> invaded <i>Gallia</i> under the conduct of
  <i>Genobald</i>, <i>Marcomir</i> and <i>Suno</i>, but were repulsed by
  <i>Stilico</i>; and <i>Marcomir</i> being slain, was succeeded in
  <i>Germany</i> by his son <i>Pharamond</i>.</p>

  <p>While these nations remained quiet within the Empire, subject to the
  <i>Romans</i>, many others continued so beyond the <i>Danube</i> till the
  death of the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>, and then rose up in arms. For
  <i>Paulus Diaconus</i> in his <i>Historia Miscell.</i> <i>lib.</i> xiv.
  speaking of the times next after the death of this Emperor, tells us:
  <i>Eodem tempore erant Gothi &amp; aliæ gentes maximæ trans Danubium
  habitantes: ex quibus rationabiliores quatuor sunt, Gothi scilicet,
  Huisogothi, Gepides &amp; Vandali; &amp; nomen tantum &amp; nihil aliud
  mutantes. Isti sub Arcadia &amp; Honorio Danubium transeuntes, locati
  sunt in terra Romanorum: &amp; Gepides quidem, ex quibus postea divisi
  sunt Longobardi &amp; Avares, villas, quæ sunt circa Singidonum &amp;
  Sirmium, habitavere:</i> and <i>Procopius</i> in the beginning of his
  <i>Historia Vandalica</i> writes to the same purpose. Hitherto the
  <i>Western Empire</i> continued entire, but now brake into many
  kingdoms.</p>

  <p><i>Theodosius</i> died A.C. 395; and then the <i>Visigoths</i>, under
  the conduct of <i>Alaric</i> the successor of <i>Fridigern</i>, rose from
  their seats in <i>Thrace</i> and wasted <i>Macedon</i>, <i>Thessaly</i>,
  <i>Achaia</i>, <i>Peloponnesus</i>, and <i>Epirus</i>, with fire and
  sword for five years together; when turning westward, they invaded
  <i>Dalmatia</i>, <i>Illyricum</i> and <i>Pannonia</i>; and from thence
  went into <i>Italy</i> A.C. 402; and the next year were so beaten at
  <i>Pollentia</i> and <i>Verona</i>, by <i>Stilico</i> the commander of
  the forces of the <i>Western Empire</i>, that <i>Claudian</i> calls the
  remainder of the forces of <i>Alaric</i>, <i>tanta ex gente reliquias
  breves</i>, and <i>Prudentius</i>, <i>Gentem deletam</i>. Thereupon
  <i>Alaric</i> made peace with the Emperor, being so far humbled, that
  <i>Orosius</i> saith, he did, <i>pro pace optima &amp; quibuscunque
  sedibus suppliciter &amp; simpliciter orare</i>. This peace was ratified
  by mutual hostages; <i>Ætius</i> was sent hostage to <i>Alaric</i>; and
  <i>Alaric</i> continued a free Prince in the seats now granted to
  him.</p>

  <p>When <i>Alaric</i> took up arms, the nations beyond the <i>Danube</i>
  began to be in motion; and the next winter, between A.C. 395 and 396, a
  great body of <i>Hunns</i>, <i>Alans</i>, <i>Ostrogoths</i>,
  <i>Gepides</i>, and other northern nations, came over the frozen
  <i>Danube</i>, being invited by <i>Rufinus</i>: when their brethren, who
  had obtained seats within the Empire, took up arms also. <i>Jerome</i>
  calls this great multitude, <i>Hunns</i>, <i>Alans</i>, <i>Vandals</i>,
  <i>Goths</i>, <i>Sarmatians</i>, <i>Quades</i>, and <i>Marcomans</i>; and
  saith, that they invaded all places between <i>Constantinople</i> and the
  <i>Julian Alps</i>, wasting <i>Scythia</i>, <i>Thrace</i>,
  <i>Macedon</i>, <i>Dardania</i>, <i>Dacia</i>, <i>Thessaly</i>,
  <i>Achaia</i>, <i>Epirus</i>, <i>Dalmatia</i>, and all <i>Pannonia</i>.
  The <i>Suevians</i> also invaded <i>Rhætia</i>: for when <i>Alaric</i>
  ravaged <i>Pannonia</i>, the <i>Romans</i> were defending <i>Rhætia</i>;
  which gave <i>Alaric</i> an opportunity of invading <i>Italy</i>, as
  <i>Claudian</i> thus mentions.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Non nisi perfidiâ nacti penetrabile tempus,</i></p>
      <p><i>Irrupere Getæ, nostras dum Rhætia vires</i></p>
      <p><i>Occupat, atque alio desudant Marte cohortes</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And when <i>Alaric</i> went from those parts into <i>Italy</i>, some
  other barbarous nations invaded <i>Noricum</i> and <i>Vindelicia</i>, as
  the same Poet <i>Claudian</i> thus writes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Jam f&#339;dera gentes</i></p>
      <p><i>Exuerant, Latiique auditâ clade feroces</i></p>
      <p><i>Vendelicos saltus &amp; Norica rura tenebant.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This was in the years 402 and 403. And among these nations I reckon
  the <i>Suevians</i>, <i>Quades</i>, and <i>Marcomans</i>; for they were
  all in arms at this time. The <i>Quades</i> and <i>Marcomans</i> were
  <i>Suevian</i> nations; and they and the <i>Suevians</i> came originally
  from <i>Bohemia</i>, and the river <i>Suevus</i> or <i>Sprake</i> in
  <i>Lusatia</i>; and were now united under one common King called
  <i>Ermeric</i>, who soon after led them into <i>Gallia</i>. The
  <i>Vandals</i> and <i>Alans</i> might also about this time extend
  themselves into <i>Noricum</i>. <i>Uldin</i> also with a great body of
  <i>Hunns</i> passed the <i>Danube</i> about the time of
  <i>Chrysostom</i>'s banishment, that is, A.C. 404, and wasted
  <i>Thrace</i> and <i>Mæsia</i>. <i>Radagaisus</i>, King of the
  <i>Gruthunni</i> and succesor of <i>Winithar</i>, inviting over more
  barbarians from beyond the <i>Danube</i>, invaded <i>Italy</i> with an
  army of above two hundred thousand <i>Goths</i>; and within a year or
  two, A.C. 405 or 406., was overcome by <i>Stilico</i>, and perished with
  his army. In this war <i>Stilico</i> was assisted with a great body of
  <i>Hunns</i> and <i>Ostrogoths</i>, under the conduct of <i>Uldin</i> and
  <i>Sarus</i>, who were hired by the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>. In all this
  confusion it was necessary for the <i>Lombards</i> in <i>Pannonia</i> to
  arm themselves in their own defence, and assert their liberty, the
  <i>Romans</i> being no longer able to protect them.</p>

  <p>And now <i>Stilico</i> purposing to make himself Emperor, procured a
  military prefecture for <i>Alaric</i>, and sent him into the <i>East</i>
  in the service of <i>Honorius</i> the <i>Western</i> Emperor, committing
  some <i>Roman</i> troops to his conduct to strengthen his army of
  <i>Goths</i>, and promising to follow soon after with his own army. His
  pretence was to recover some regions of <i>Illyricum</i>, which the
  <i>Eastern</i> Emperor was accused to detain injuriously from the
  <i>Western</i>; but his secret design was to make himself Emperor, by the
  assistance of the <i>Vandals</i> and their allies: for he himself was a
  <i>Vandal</i>. For facilitating this design, he invited a great body of
  the barbarous nations to invade the <i>Western Empire</i>, while he and
  <i>Alaric</i> invaded the <i>Eastern</i>. And these nations under their
  several Kings, the <i>Vandals</i> under <i>Godegisilus</i>, the
  <i>Alans</i> in two bodies, the one under <i>Goar</i>, the other under
  <i>Resplendial</i>, and the <i>Suevians</i>, <i>Quades</i>, and
  <i>Marcomans</i>, under <i>Ermeric</i>, marched thro' <i>Rhætia</i> to
  the side of the <i>Rhine</i>, leaving their seats in <i>Pannonia</i> to
  the <i>Hunns</i> and <i>Ostrogoths</i>, and joined the <i>Burgundians</i>
  under <i>Gundicar</i>, and ruffled the <i>Franks</i> in their further
  march. On the last of <i>December</i> A.C. 406, they passed the
  <i>Rhine</i> at <i>Ments</i>, and spread themselves into <i>Germania
  prima</i> and the adjacent regions; and amongst other actions the
  <i>Vandals</i> took <i>Triers</i>. Then they advanced into
  <i>Belgium</i>, and began to waste that country. Whereupon the <i>Salian
  Franks</i> in <i>Brabant</i> took up arms, and under the conduct of
  <i>Theudomir</i>, the son of <i>Ricimer</i>, or <i>Richomer</i>,
  abovementioned, made so stout a resistance, that they slew almost twenty
  thousand of the <i>Vandals</i>, with their King <i>Godegesilus</i>, in
  battel; the rest escaping only by a party of <i>Resplendial</i>'s
  <i>Alans</i> which came timely to their assistance.</p>

  <p>Then the <i>British</i> soldiers, alarm'd by the rumour of these
  things, revolted, and set up Tyrants there; first <i>Marcus</i>, whom
  they slew presently; then <i>Gratian</i>, whom they slew within four
  months; and lastly <i>Constantine</i>, under whom they invaded
  <i>Gallia</i> A.C. 408, being favoured by <i>Goar</i> and
  <i>Gundicar</i>. And <i>Constantine</i> having possessed a good part of
  <i>Gallia</i>, created his son <i>Constans Cæsar</i>, and sent him into
  <i>Spain</i> to order his affairs there, A.C. 409.</p>

  <p>In the mean time <i>Resplendial</i>, seeing the aforesaid disaster of
  the <i>Vandals</i>, and that <i>Goar</i> was gone over to the
  <i>Romans</i>, led his army from the <i>Rhine</i>; and, together with the
  <i>Suevians</i> and residue of the <i>Vandals</i>, went towards
  <i>Spain</i>; the <i>Franks</i> in the mean time prosecuting their
  victory so far as to retake <i>Triers</i>, which after they had plundered
  they left to the <i>Romans</i>. The <i>Barbarians</i> were at first stopt
  by the <i>Pyrenean</i> mountains, which made them spread themselves into
  <i>Aquitain</i>: but the next year they had the passage betrayed by some
  soldiers of <i>Constans</i>; and entring <i>Spain</i> 4 Kal.
  <i>Octob.</i> A.C. 409, they conquered every one what he could; and at
  length, A.C. 411, divided their conquests by lot; the <i>Vandals</i>
  obtained <i>B&#339;tica</i>, and part of <i>Gallæcia</i>; the
  <i>Suevians</i> the rest of <i>Gallæcia</i>; and the <i>Alans</i>
  <i>Lusitania</i> and the <i>Carthaginian</i> Province: the Emperor for
  the sake of peace confirming them in those seats by grant A.C. 413.</p>

  <p>The <i>Roman Franks</i> abovementioned, having made <i>Theudomir</i>
  their King, began strait after their conquest of the <i>Vandals</i> to
  invade their neighbours also. The first they set upon were the
  <i>Gauls</i> of <i>Brabant</i><a name="NtpDanV_2"
  href="#NtDanV_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>: but meeting with notable resistance,
  they desired their alliance: and so those <i>Gauls</i> fell off from the
  <i>Romans</i>, and made an intimate league with the <i>Franks</i> to be
  as one people, marrying with one another, and conforming to one another's
  manners, till they became one without distinction. Thus by the access of
  these <i>Gauls</i>, and of the foreign <i>Franks</i> also, who afterwards
  came over the <i>Rhine</i>, the <i>Salian</i> kingdom soon grew very
  great and powerful.</p>

  <p><i>Stilico</i>'s expedition against the <i>Greek</i> Emperor was stopt
  by the order of <i>Honorius</i>; and then <i>Alaric</i> came out of
  <i>Epirus</i> into <i>Noricum</i>, and requested a sum of money for his
  service. The Senate were inclined to deny him, but by <i>Stilico</i>'s
  mediation granted it. But after some time <i>Stilico</i> being accused of
  a traiterous conspiracy with <i>Alaric</i>, and slain 10 Kal.
  <i>Sept.</i> A.C. 408; <i>Alaric</i> was thereby disappointed of his
  money, and reputed an enemy to the Empire; he then broke strait into
  <i>Italy</i> with the army he brought out of <i>Epirus</i>, and sent to
  his brother <i>Adolphus</i> to follow him with what forces he had in
  <i>Pannonia</i>, which were not great, but yet not to be despised.
  Thereupon <i>Honorius</i> fearing to be shut up in <i>Rome</i>, retired
  to <i>Ravenna</i> in <i>October</i> A.C. 408. And from that time
  <i>Ravenna</i> continued to be the seat of the <i>Western</i> Emperors.
  In those days the <i>Hunns</i> also invaded <i>Pannonia</i>; and seizing
  the deserted seats of the <i>Vandals</i>, <i>Alans</i>, and <i>Goths</i>,
  founded a new kingdom there. <i>Alaric</i> advancing to <i>Rome</i>
  besieged it, and 9 Kal. <i>Sept.</i> A.C. 410 took it: and afterwards
  attempting to pass into <i>Africa</i>, was shipwrackt. After which
  <i>Honorius</i> made peace with him, and got up an army to send against
  the Tyrant <i>Constantine</i>.</p>

  <p>At the same time <i>Gerontius</i>, one of <i>Constantine</i>'s
  captains, revolted from him, and set up <i>Maximus</i> Emperor in
  <i>Spain</i>. Whereupon <i>Constantine</i> sent <i>Edobec</i>, another of
  his captains, to draw to his assistance, the <i>Barbarians</i> under
  <i>Goar</i> and <i>Gundicar</i> in <i>Gallia</i>, and supplies of
  <i>Franks</i> and <i>Alemans</i> from beyond the <i>Rhine</i>; and
  committed the custody of <i>Vienne</i> in <i>Gallia Narbonensis</i> to
  his son <i>Constans</i>. <i>Gerontius</i> advancing, first slew
  <i>Constans</i> at <i>Vienne</i>, and then began to besiege
  <i>Constantine</i> at <i>Arles</i>. But <i>Honorius</i> at the same time
  sending <i>Constantius</i> with an army on the same errand,
  <i>Gerontius</i> fled, and <i>Constantius</i> continued the siege,
  strengthned by the access of the greatest part of the soldiers of
  <i>Gerontius</i>. After four months siege, <i>Edobec</i> having procured
  succours, the <i>Barbarian</i> Kings at <i>Ments</i>, <i>Goar</i> and
  <i>Gundicar</i>, constitute <i>Jovinus</i> Emperor, and together with him
  set forward to relieve <i>Arles</i>. At their approach <i>Constantius</i>
  retired. They pursued, and he beat them by surprize; but not prosecuting
  his victory, the <i>Barbarians</i> soon recovered themselves; yet not so
  as to hinder the fall of the tyrants <i>Constantine</i>, <i>Jovinus</i>
  and <i>Maximus</i>. <i>Britain</i> could not be recovered to the Empire,
  but remained ever after a distinct kingdom.</p>

  <p>The next year, A.C. 412, the <i>Visigoths</i> being beaten in
  <i>Italy</i>, had <i>Aquitain</i> granted them to retire into: and they
  invaded it with much violence, causing the <i>Alans</i> and
  <i>Burgundians</i> to retreat, who were then depopulating of it. At the
  same time the <i>Burgundians</i> were brought to peace; and the Emperor
  granted them for inheritance a region upon the <i>Rhine</i> which they
  had invaded: and the same, I presume, he did with the <i>Alans</i>. But
  the <i>Franks</i> not long after retaking and burning <i>Triers</i>,
  <i>Castinus</i>, A.C. 415, was sent against them with an army, who routed
  them and slew <i>Theudomir</i> their King This was the second taking of
  <i>Triers</i> by the <i>Franks</i>. It was therefore taken four times,
  once by the <i>Vandals</i> and thrice by the <i>Franks</i>.
  <i>Theudomir</i> was succeeded by <i>Pharamond</i>, the Prince or King of
  the <i>Salian Franks</i> in <i>Germany</i>. From thence he brought new
  forces, reigned over the whole, and had seats granted to his people
  within the Empire near the <i>Rhine</i>.</p>

  <p>And now the <i>Barbarians</i> were all quieted, and settled in several
  kingdoms within the Empire, not only by conquest, but also by the grants
  of the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>. For <i>Rutilius</i> in his
  <i>Itinerary</i>, written in Autumn, <i>Anno Urbis</i> 1169, that is,
  according to <i>Varro</i>'s computation then in use, A.C. 416, thus
  laments the wasted fields:</p>

  417, represents now a general pacification of the barbarous nations by
  the words <i>comprimere</i>, <i>coangustare</i>, <i>addicere gentes
  immanissimas</i>; terming them <i>imperio addictas</i>, because they had
  obtained seats in the Empire by league and compact; and
  <i>coangustatas</i>, because they did no longer invade all regions at
  pleasure, but by the same compact remained quiet in the seats then
  granted them. And these are the kingdoms, of which the feet of the Image
  were henceforward composed, and which are represented by iron and clay
  intermixed, which did not stick one to another, and were of different
  strength.</p>

  <p>Seven of these kingdoms are thus mentioned by <i>Sigonius</i>.
  <sup>1</sup><i>Honorio regnante</i>, <i>in Pannoniam</i>
  <sup>2</sup><i>Hunni</i>, <i>in Hispaniam</i> <sup>3</sup><i>Vandali</i>,
  <sup>4</sup><i>Alani</i>, <sup>5</sup><i>Suevi</i> &amp;
  <sup>6</sup><i>Gothi</i>, <i>in Galliam</i> <sup>4</sup><i>Alani</i>
  <sup>7</sup><i>Burgundiones</i> &amp; <sup>6</sup><i>Gothi</i>, <i>certis
  sedibus permissis, accepti</i>. Add the <i>Franks</i>, <i>Britains</i>,
  and <i>Lombards</i>, and you have the ten: for these arose about the same
  time with the seven. But let us view them severally.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_1">1</a>. The Kings of the <i>Vandals</i> were, A.C.
  407 <i>Godegesilus</i>, 407 <i>Gunderic</i>, 426 <i>Geiseric</i>, 477
  <i>Hunneric</i>, 484 <i>Gundemund</i>, 496 <i>Thrasamund</i>, 513
  <i>Geiseric</i>, 530 <i>Gelimer</i>. <i>Godegesilus</i> led them into
  <i>Gallia</i> A.C. 406, <i>Gunderic</i> into <i>Spain</i> A.C. 409,
  <i>Geiseric</i> into <i>Africa</i> A.C. 427; and <i>Gelimer</i> was
  conquered by <i>Belisarius</i> A.C. 533. Their kingdom lasted in
  <i>Gallia</i>, <i>Spain</i> and <i>Africa</i> together 126 years; and in
  <i>Africa</i> they were very potent. The <i>Alans</i> had only two Kings
  of their own in <i>Spain</i>, <i>Resplendial</i>, and <i>Ataces</i>,
  <i>Utacus</i> or <i>Othacar</i>. Under <i>Resplendial</i> they went into
  <i>France</i> A.C. 407, and into <i>Spain</i> A.C. 409. <i>Ataces</i> was
  slain with almost all his army by <i>Vallia</i> King of the
  <i>Visigoths</i> A.C. 419. And then the remainder of these <i>Alans</i>
  subjected themselves to <i>Gunderic</i> King of the <i>Vandals</i> in
  <i>B&#339;tica</i>, and went afterwards with them into <i>Africa</i>, as
  I learn out of <i>Procopius</i>. Whence the Kings of the <i>Vandals</i>
  styled themselves Kings of the <i>Vandals</i> and <i>Alans</i>; as may be
  seen in the Edict of <i>Hunneric</i> recited by <i>Victor</i> in his
  <i>Vandalic</i> persecution. In conjunction with the <i>Chatti</i>, these
  <i>Alans</i> gave the name of <i>Cathalaunia</i>, or <i>Catth-Alania</i>,
  to the Province which is still so called. These <i>Alans</i> had also
  <i>Gepides</i> among them; and therefore the <i>Gepides</i> came into
  <i>Pannonia</i> before the <i>Alans</i> left it. There they became
  subject to the <i>Hunns</i> till the death of <i>Attila</i> A.C. 454, and
  at length were conquered by the <i>Ostrogoths</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_2">2</a>. The Kings of the <i>Suevians</i> were, A.C.
  407 <i>Ermeric</i>, 458 <i>Rechila</i>, 448 <i>Rechiarius</i>, 458
  <i>Maldra</i>, 460 <i>Frumarius</i>, 463 <i>Regismund</i>. And after some
  other Kings who are unknown, reigned A.C. 558 <i>Theudomir</i>, 568
  <i>Miro</i>, 582 <i>Euboricus</i>, and 583 <i>Andeca</i>. This kingdom,
  after it had been once seated in <i>Spain</i>, remained always in
  <i>Gallæcia</i> and <i>Lusitania</i>. <i>Ermeric</i> after the fall of
  the <i>Alan</i> kingdom, enlarged it into all <i>Gallæcia</i>, forcing
  the <i>Vandals</i> to retire into <i>B&#339;tica</i> and the
  <i>Carthaginian</i> Province. This kingdom lasted 177 years according to
  <i>Isidorus</i>, and then was subdued by <i>Leovigildus</i> King of the
  <i>Visigoths</i>, and made a Province of his kingdom A.C. 585.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_3">3</a>. The Kings of the <i>Visigoths</i> were, A.C.
  400 <i>Alaric</i>, 410 <i>Athaulphus</i>, 415 <i>Sergeric</i> and
  <i>Vallia</i>, 419 <i>Theoderic</i>, 451 <i>Thorismund</i>, 452
  <i>Theoderic</i>, 465 <i>Euric</i>, 482 <i>Alaric</i>, 505
  <i>Gensalaric</i>, 526 <i>Amalaric</i>, 531 <i>Theudius</i>, 548
  <i>Theudisclus</i>, &amp;c. I date this kingdom from the time that
  <i>Alaric</i> left <i>Thrace</i> and <i>Greece</i> to invade the
  <i>Western Empire</i>. In the end of the reign of <i>Athaulphus</i> the
  <i>Goths</i> were humbled by the <i>Romans</i>, and attempted to pass out
  of <i>France</i> into <i>Spain</i>. <i>Sergeric</i> reigned but a few
  days. In the beginning of <i>Vallia</i>'s reign they assaulted the
  <i>Romans</i> afresh, but were again repulsed, and then made peace on
  this condition, that they should on the behalf of the Empire invade the
  <i>Barbarian</i> kingdoms in <i>Spain</i>: and this they did, together
  with the <i>Romans</i>, in the years 417 and 418, overthrowing the
  <i>Alans</i> and part of the <i>Vandals</i>. Then they received
  <i>Aquitain</i> of the Emperor by a full donation, leaving their
  conquests in <i>Spain</i> to the Emperor: and thereby the seats of the
  conquered <i>Alans</i> came into the hands of the <i>Romans</i>. In the
  year 455, <i>Theoderic</i>, assisted by the <i>Burgundians</i>, invaded
  <i>Spain</i>, which was then almost all subject to the <i>Suevians</i>,
  and took a part of it from them. A.C. 506, the <i>Goths</i> were driven
  out of <i>Gallia</i> by the <i>Franks</i>. A.C. 585, they conquered the
  <i>Suevian</i> kingdom, and became Lords of all <i>Spain</i>. A.C. 713,
  the <i>Saracens</i> invaded them, but in time they recovered their
  dominions, and have reigned in <i>Spain</i> ever since.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_4">4</a>. The Kings of the <i>Alans</i> in
  <i>Gallia</i> were <i>Goar</i>, <i>Sambida</i>, <i>Eocharic</i>,
  <i>Sangibanus</i>, <i>Beurgus</i>, &amp;c. Under <i>Goar</i> they invaded
  <i>Gallia</i> A.C. 407, and had seats given them near the <i>Rhine</i>,
  A.C. 412. Under <i>Sambida</i>, whom <i>Bucher</i> makes the successor,
  if not the son of <i>Goar</i>, they had the territories of <i>Valence</i>
  given them by <i>Ætius</i> the Emperor's General, A.C. 440. Under
  <i>Eocharic</i> they conquered a region of the rebelling <i>Galli
  Arborici</i>, given them also by <i>Ætius</i>. This region was from them
  named <i>Alenconium, quasi Alanorum conventus</i>. Under
  <i>Sangibanus</i> they were invaded, and their regal city <i>Orleans</i>
  was besieged by <i>Attila</i> King of the <i>Hunns</i>, with a vast army
  of 500000 men. <i>Ætius</i> and the <i>Barbarian</i> Kings of
  <i>Gallia</i> came to raise the siege, and beat the <i>Hunns</i> in a
  very memorable battle, A.C. 451, <i>in campis Catalaunicis</i>, so called
  from these <i>Alans</i> mixt with the <i>Chatti</i>. The region is now
  called <i>Campania</i> or <i>Champagne</i>. In that battle were slain on
  both sides 162000 men. A year or two after, <i>Attila</i> returned with
  an immense army to conquer this kingdom, but was again beaten by them and
  the <i>Visigoths</i> together in a battle of three days continuance, with
  a slaughter almost as great as the former. Under <i>Beurgus</i>, or
  <i>Biorgor</i>, they infested <i>Gallia</i> round about, till the reign
  of <i>Maximus</i> the Emperor; and then they passed the <i>Alps</i> in
  winter, and came into <i>Liguria</i>, but were there beaten, and
  <i>Beurgus</i> slain, by <i>Ricimer</i> commander of the Emperor's
  forces, A.C. 464. Afterwards they were again beaten, by the joint force
  of <i>Odoacer</i> King of <i>Italy</i> and <i>Childeric</i> King of the
  <i>Franks</i>, about the year 480, and again by <i>Theudobert</i> King of
  the <i>Austrian Franks</i> about the year 511.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_5">5</a>. The Kings of the <i>Burgundians</i> were,
  A.C. 407 <i>Gundicar</i>, 436 <i>Gundioc</i>, 467 <i>Bilimer</i>, 473
  <i>Gundobaldus</i> with his brothers, 510 <i>Sigismund</i>, 517
  <i>Godomarus</i>. Under <i>Gundicar</i> they invaded <i>Gallia</i> A.C.
  407, and had seats given them by the Emperor near the <i>Rhine</i> in
  <i>Gallia Belgica</i>, A.C. 412. They had <i>Saxons</i> among them, and
  were now so potent, that <i>Orosius</i> A.C. 417 wrote of them:
  '<i>Burgundionum esse prævalidam manum, Galliæ hodieque testes sunt, in
  quibus præsumpta possessione consistunt</i>. About the year 435 they
  received great overthrows by <i>Ætius</i>, and soon after by the
  <i>Hunns</i>: but five years after had <i>Savoy</i> granted them to be
  shared with the inhabitants; and from that time became again a potent
  kingdom, being bounded by the river <i>Rhodanus</i>, but afterwards
  extending much further into the heart of <i>Gallia</i>. <i>Gundobald</i>
  conquered the regions about the rivers <i>Araris</i> and <i>Rhodanus</i>,
  with the territories of <i>Marseilles</i>; and invading <i>Italy</i> in
  the time of the Emperor <i>Glycerius</i>, conquered all his brethren.
  <i>Godomarus</i> made <i>Orleans</i> his royal seat: whence the kingdom
  was called <i>Regnum Aurelianorum</i>. He was conquered by
  <i>Clotharius</i> and <i>Childebert</i>, Kings of the <i>Franks</i>, A.C.
  526. From thenceforward this kingdom was sometimes united to the kingdom
  of the <i>Franks</i>, and sometimes divided from it, till the reign of
  <i>Charles</i> the great, who made his son <i>Carolottus</i> King of
  <i>Burgundy</i>. From that time, for about 300 years together, it enjoyed
  its proper Kings; and was then broken into the Dukedom of
  <i>Burgundy</i>, County of <i>Burgundy</i>, and County of <i>Savoy</i>;
  and afterwards those were broken into other lesser Counties.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_6">6</a>. The Kings of the <i>Franks</i> were, A.C. 407
  <i>Theudomir</i>, 417 <i>Pharamond</i>, 428 <i>Clodio</i>, 448
  <i>Merovæus</i>, 456 <i>Childeric</i>, 482 <i>Clodovæus</i>, &amp;c.
  <i>Windeline</i> and <i>Bucher</i>, two of the most diligent searchers
  into the originals of this kingdom, make it begin the same year with the
  <i>Barbarian</i> invasions of <i>Gallia</i>, that is, A.C. 407. Of the
  first Kings there is in <i>Labbe's Bibliotheca M.S.</i> this record.</p>

  <p><i>Historica quædam excerpta ex veteri stemmate genealogico Regum
  Franciæ</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Genobaldus, Marcomerus, Suno, Theodemeris. Isti duces vel reguli
  extiterunt à principio gentis Francorum diversis temporibus. Sed incertum
  relinquunt historici quali sibi procreations lineâ successerunt</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Pharamundus: sub hoc rege suo primo Franci legibus se subdunt, quas
  primores eorum tulerunt Wisogastus, Atrogastus, Salegastus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Chlochilo. Iste, transito Rheno, Romanos in Carbonaria sylva
  devicit, Camaracum cepit &amp; obtinuit, annis 20 regnavit. Sub hoc rege
  Franci usque Summam progressi sunt</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Merovechus. Sub hoc rege Franci Trevirim destruunt, Metim
  succendunt, usque Aurelianum perveniunt</i>.</p>

  <p>Now for <i>Genobaldus</i>, <i>Marcomer</i> and <i>Suno</i>, they were
  captains of the <i>Transrhenane Franks</i> in the reign of
  <i>Theodosius</i>, and concern us not. We are to begin with
  <i>Theudomir</i> the first King of the rebelling <i>Salii</i>, called
  <i>Didio</i> by <i>Ivo Carnotensis</i>, and <i>Thiedo</i> and
  <i>Theudemerus</i> by <i>Rhenanus</i>. His face is extant in a coin of
  gold found with this inscription, THEUDEMIR REX, published by
  <i>Petavius</i>, and still or lately extant, as <i>Windeline</i>
  testifies: which shews that he was a King, and that in <i>Gallia</i>;
  seeing that rude <i>Germany</i> understood not then the coining of money,
  nor used either <i>Latin</i> words or letters. He was the son of
  <i>Ricimer</i>, or <i>Richomer</i>, the favourite of the Emperor
  <i>Theodosius</i>; and so being a <i>Roman Frank</i>, and of the
  <i>Salian</i> royal blood, they therefore upon the rebellion made him
  King. The whole time of his reign you have stated in <i>Excerptis
  Gregorii Turonensis è Fredigario</i>, <i>cap.</i> 5, 6, 7, 8. where the
  making him King, the tyranny of <i>Jovinus</i>, the slaughter of the
  associates of <i>Jovinus</i>, the second taking of <i>Triers</i> by the
  <i>Franks</i>, and their war with <i>Castinus</i>, in which this King was
  slain, are as a series of successive things thus set down in order.
  <i>Extinctis Ducibus in Francis, denuo Reges creantur ex eadem stirpe qua
  prius fuerant. Eodem tempore Jovinus ornatus regios assumpsit.
  Constantinus fugam versus Italiam dirigit; missis a Jovino Principe
  percussoribus super Mentio flumine, capite truncatur. Multi nobilium
  jussu Jovini apud Avernis capti, &amp; a ducibus Honorii crudeliter
  interempti sunt. Trevirorum civitas, factione unius ex senatoribus nomine
  Lucii, à Francis captà &amp; incensa est.&mdash;Castinus Domesticorum
  Comes expeditionem accipit contra Francos</i>, &amp;c. Then returning to
  speak of <i>Theudomir</i>, he adds: <i>Franci electum à se regem, sicut
  prius fuerat, crinitum inquirentes diligenter ex genere Priami, Frigi
  &amp; Francionis, super se crearunt nomine Theudemerum filium Richemeris,
  qui in hoc prælio quod supra memini, à Romanis interfectus est</i>; that
  is, in the battle with <i>Castinus</i>'s army. Of his death <i>Gregory
  Turonensis</i> makes this further mention: <i>In consularibus legimus
  Theodemerem regem Francorum filium Ricimeris quondam, &amp; Ascilam
  matrem ejus, gladio interfectos</i>.</p>

  <p>Upon this victory of the <i>Romans</i>, the <i>Franks</i> and
  rebelling <i>Gauls</i>, who in the time of <i>Theudomir</i> were at war
  with one another, united to strengthen themselves, as <i>Ordericus
  Vitalis</i><a name="NtpDanVI_1" href="#NtDanVI_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> thus
  mentions. <i>Cum Galli prius contra Romanos rebellâssent, Franci iis
  sociati sunt, &amp; pariter juncti, Ferramundum Sunonis ducis filium,
  sibi regem præfecerunt</i>. <i>Prosper</i> sets down the time; <i>Anno 25
  Honorii, Pharamundus regnat in Francia</i>. This, <i>Bucher</i> well
  observes, refers to the end of the year 416, or the beginning of the next
  year, dating the years of <i>Honorius</i> from the death of
  <i>Valentinian</i>; and argues well, that at this time <i>Pharamond</i>
  was not only King by the constitution of the <i>Franks</i>, but crowned
  also by the consent of <i>Honorius</i>, and had a part of <i>Gallia</i>
  assigned him by covenant. And this might be the cause that <i>Roman</i>
  writers reckoned him the first King: which some not understanding, have
  reputed him the founder of this kingdom by an army of the <i>Transrhenane
  Franks</i>. He might come with such an army, but he succeeded
  <i>Theudomir</i> by right of blood and consent of the people. For the
  above cited passage of <i>Fredigarius</i>, <i>Extinctis Ducibus, in
  Francis denuo Reges creantur ex eadem stirpe quâ prius fuerant</i>,
  implies that the kingdom continued to this new elected family during the
  reign of more Kings than one. If you date the years of <i>Honorius</i>
  from the death of his father, the reign of <i>Pharamond</i> might begin
  two years later than is assigned by <i>Bucher</i>. The <i>Salique</i>
  laws made in his reign, which are yet extant, shew by their name that it
  was the kingdom of the <i>Salii</i> over which he reigned; and, by the
  pecuniary mulcts in them, that the place where he reigned abounded much
  with money, and consequently was within the Empire; rude <i>Germany</i>
  knowing not the use of money, till they mixed with the <i>Romans</i>. In
  the Preface also to the <i>Salique</i> laws, written and prefixed to them
  soon after the conversion of the <i>Franks</i> to the Christian religion,
  that is, in the end of the reign of <i>Merovæus</i>, or soon after, the
  original of this kingdom is thus described: <i>Hæc enim gens, quæ fortis
  dum esset &amp; robore valida, Romanorum jugum durissimum de suis
  cervicibus excussit pugnando</i>, &amp;c. This kingdom therefore was
  erected, not by invasion but by rebellion, as was described above.
  <i>Prosper</i> in registering their Kings in order, tells us:
  <i>Pharamundus regnat in Francia; Clodio regnat in Francia; Merovæus
  regnat in Francia</i>: and who can imagine but that in all these places
  he meant one and the same <i>Francia</i>? And yet 'tis certain that the
  <i>Francia</i> of <i>Merovæus</i> was in <i>Gallia</i>.</p>

  <p>Yet the father of <i>Pharamond</i>, being king of a body of
  <i>Franks</i> in <i>Germany</i> in the reign of the Emperor
  <i>Theodosius</i>, as above, <i>Pharamond</i> might reign over the same
  <i>Franks</i> in <i>Germany</i> before he succeeded <i>Theudomir</i> in
  the kingdom of the <i>Salians</i> within the Empire, and even before
  <i>Theudomir</i> began his reign; suppose in the first year of
  <i>Honorius</i>, or when those <i>Franks</i> being repulsed by
  <i>Stilico</i>, lost their Kings <i>Marcomir</i> and <i>Suno</i>, one of
  which was the father of <i>Pharamond</i>: and the <i>Roman Franks</i>,
  after the death of <i>Theudomir</i>, might invite <i>Pharamond</i> with
  his people from beyond the <i>Rhine</i>. But we are not to regard the
  reign of <i>Pharamond</i> in <i>Germany</i>: we are to date this kingdom
  from its rise within the Empire, and to look upon it as strengthened by
  the access of other <i>Franks</i> coming from beyond the <i>Rhine</i>,
  whether in the reign of this King or in that of his successor
  <i>Clodio</i>. For in the last year of <i>Pharamond</i>'s reign,
  <i>Ætius</i> took from him a part of his possession in <i>Gallia</i>: but
  his successor <i>Clodio</i>, whom <i>Fredigarius</i> represents as the
  son of <i>Theudomir</i>, and some call <i>Clogio</i>, <i>Cloio</i>, and
  <i>Claudius</i>, inviting from beyond the <i>Rhine</i> a great body of
  <i>Franks</i>, recovered all, and carried on their conquests as far as
  the river <i>Soame</i>. Then those <i>Franks</i> dividing conquests with
  him, erected certain new kingdoms at <i>Cologn</i> and <i>Cambray</i>,
  and some other cities: all which were afterwards conquered by
  <i>Clodovæus</i>, who also drove the <i>Goths</i> out of <i>Gallia</i>,
  and fix'd his seat at <i>Paris</i>, where it has continued ever since.
  And this was the original of the present kingdom of <i>France</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_7">7</a>. The Kings of <i>Britain</i> were, A.C. 407 or
  408, <i>Marcus</i>, <i>Gratian</i>, and <i>Constantine</i> successively;
  A.C. 425 <i>Vortigern</i>, 466 <i>Aurelius Ambrosius</i>, 498 <i>Uther
  Pendraco</i>, 508 <i>Arthur</i>, 542 <i>Constantinus</i>, 545 <i>Aurelius
  Cunanus</i>, 578 <i>Vortiporeus</i>, 581 <i>Malgo</i>, 586
  <i>Careticus</i>, 613 <i>Cadwan</i>, 635 <i>Cadwalin</i>, 676
  <i>Cadwallader</i>. The three first were <i>Roman</i> Tyrants, who
  revolted from the Empire. <i>Orosius</i>, <i>Prosper</i> and
  <i>Zosimus</i> connect their revolt with the irruptions of the
  <i>Barbarians</i> into <i>Gallia</i>, as consequent thereunto.
  <i>Prosper</i>, with whom <i>Zosimus</i> agrees, puts it in the year
  which began the day after that irruption. The just time I thus collect:
  <i>Marcus</i> reigned not many days, <i>Gratian</i> four months, and
  <i>Constantine</i> three years. He was slain the year after the taking of
  <i>Rome</i>, that is A.C. 411, 14 Kal. <i>Octob.</i> Whence the revolt
  was in Spring A.C. 408. <i>Sozomen</i> joins <i>Constantine</i>'s
  expedition into <i>Gallia</i> with <i>Arcadius</i>'s death, or the times
  a little after; and <i>Arcadius</i> died A.C. 408 <i>May</i> the 1st. Now
  tho the reign of these Tyrants was but short, yet they gave a beginning
  to the kingdom of <i>Britain</i>, and so may be reckoned the three first
  Kings, especially since the posterity of <i>Constantine</i>, <i>viz.</i>
  his sons <i>Aurelius Ambrosius</i>, and <i>Uther Pendraco</i>, and his
  grandson <i>Arthur</i>, reigned afterwards. For from the time of the
  revolt of these Tyrants <i>Britain</i> continued a distict kingdom
  absolved from subjection to the Empire, the Emperor not being able to
  spare soldiers to be sent thither to receive and keep the Island, and
  therefore neglecting it; as we learn by unquestionable records. For
  <i>Prosper</i> tells us; <i>A.C.</i> 410, <i>Variane Cos. Hac tempestate
  præ valetudine Romanorum, vires funditùs attenuatæ Britanniæ</i>. And
  <i>Sigebert</i>, conjoining this with the siege of <i>Rome</i>, saith:
  <i>Britannorum vires attenuatæ, &amp; substrahunt se à Romanorum
  dominatione</i>. And <i>Zosimus</i> <i>lib.</i> 6. <i>The
  </i>Transrhenane Barbarians<i> invading all places, reduced the

  <i>they lived in separate bodies after their own pleasure. The

  </i>Gauls<i> imitating the </i>Britons<i>, freed themselves also,
  ejecting the </i>Roman<i> Presidents, and forming themselves into a sort
  of commonwealth according to their own pleasure. This rebellion of
  </i>Britain<i> and the </i>Celtic<i> nations happened when
  </i>Constantine<i> usurped the kingdom</i>. So also <i>Procopius</i>,

  could not recover </i>Britain<i> any more, but from that time it remained

  <i>Theodoret</i>, <i>serm.</i> 9. <i>de curand. Græc. affect</i>. about
  the year 424, reckons the <i>Britons</i> among the nations which were not
  then in subjection to the <i>Roman</i> Empire. Thus <i>Sigonius</i>:
  <i>ad annum 411, Imperium Romanorum post excessum Constantini in
  Britannia nullum fuit</i>.</p>

  <p>Between the death of <i>Constantine</i> and the reign of
  <i>Vortigern</i> was an interregnum of about 14 years, in which the
  <i>Britons</i> had wars with the <i>Picts</i> and <i>Scots</i>, and twice
  obtained the assistance of a <i>Roman</i> Legion, who drove out the
  enemy, but told them positively at their departure that they would come
  no more. Of <i>Vortigern</i>'s beginning to reign there is this record in
  an old Chronicle in <i>Nennius</i>, quoted by <i>Camden</i> and others:
  <i>Guortigernus tenuit imperium in Britannia, Theodosio &amp;
  Valentiniano Coss.</i> [<i>viz.</i> A.C. 425.] <i>&amp; in quarto anno
  regni sui Saxones ad Britanniam venerunt, Felice &amp; Tauro Coss.</i>
  [<i>viz.</i> A.C. 428.] This coming of the <i>Saxons</i>, <i>Sigebert</i>
  refers to the 4th year of <i>Valentinian</i>, which falls in with the
  year 428 assigned by this Chronicle: and two years after, the
  <i>Saxons</i> together with the <i>Picts</i> were beaten by the
  <i>Britons</i>. Afterwards in the reign of <i>Martian</i> the Emperor,
  that is, between the years 450 and 456, the <i>Saxons</i> under
  <i>Hengist</i> were called in by the <i>Britons</i>, but six years after
  revolted from them, made war upon them with various success, and by
  degrees succeeded them. Yet the <i>Britons</i> continued a flourishing
  kingdom till the reign of <i>Careticus</i>; and the war between the two
  nations continued till the pontificate of <i>Sergius</i> A.C. 688.<a

  <p><a name="DanVI_8">8</a>. The Kings of the <i>Hunns</i> were, A.C. 406
  <i>Octar</i> and <i>Rugila</i>, 433 <i>Bleda</i> and <i>Attila</i>.
  <i>Octar</i> and <i>Rugila</i> were the brothers of <i>Munzuc</i> King of
  the <i>Hunns</i> in <i>Gothia</i> beyond the <i>Danube</i>; and
  <i>Bleda</i> and <i>Attila</i> were his sons, and <i>Munzuc</i> was the
  son of <i>Balamir</i>. The two first, as <i>Jornandes</i> tells us, were
  Kings of the <i>Hunns</i>, but not of them all; and had the two last for
  their successors. I date the reign of the <i>Hunns</i> in <i>Pannonia</i>
  from the time that the <i>Vandals</i> and <i>Alans</i> relinquished
  <i>Pannonia</i> to them, A.C. 407. <i>Sigonius</i> from the time that the
  <i>Visigoths</i> relinquished <i>Pannonia</i> A. C. 408. <i>Constat</i>,
  saith he, <i>quod Gothis ex Illyrico profectis, Hunni successerunt, atque
  imprimis Pannoniam tenuerunt. Neque enim Honorius viribus ad resistendum
  in tantis difficultatibus destitutus, prorsus eos prohibere potuit, sed
  meliore consilio, animo ad pacem converso, f&#339;dus cum eis, datis
  acceptisque obsidibus fecit; ex quibus qui dati sunt, Ætius, qui etiam
  Alarico tributus fuerat, præcipue memoratur</i>. How <i>Ætius</i> was
  hostage to the <i>Goths</i> and <i>Hunns</i> is related by
  <i>Frigeridus</i>, who when he had mentioned that <i>Theodosius</i>
  Emperor of the <i>East</i> had sent grievous commands to <i>John</i>, who
  after the death of <i>Honorius</i> had usurped the crown of the
  <i>Western Empire</i>, he subjoins: <i>Iis permotus Johannes, Ætium id
  tempus curam palatii gerentem cum ingenti auri pondere ad Chunnos
  transmisit, notos sibi obsidiatûs sui tempore &amp; familiari amicitiâ
  devinctos</i>&mdash;And a little after: <i>Ætius tribus annis Alarici
  obses, dehinc Chunnorum, postea Carpilionis gener ex Comite domesticorum
  &amp; Joannis curopalatæ.</i> Now <i>Bucher</i> shews that <i>Ætius</i>
  was hostage to <i>Alaric</i> till the year 410, when <i>Alaric</i> died,
  and to the <i>Hunns</i> between the years 411 and 415, and son-in-law to
  <i>Carpilio</i> about the year 417 or 418, and <i>Curopalates</i> to
  <i>John</i> about the end of the year 423. Whence 'tis probable that he
  became hostage to the <i>Hunns</i> about the year 412 or 413, when
  <i>Honorius</i> made leagues with almost all the barbarous nations, and
  granted them seats: but I had rather say with <i>Sigonius</i>, that
  <i>Ætius</i> became hostage to <i>Alaric</i> A.C. 403. It is further
  manifest out of <i>Prosper</i>, that the <i>Hunns</i> were in quiet
  possession of <i>Pannonia</i> in the year 432. For in the first book of
  <i>Eusebius</i>'s Chronicle <i>Prosper</i> writes: <i>Anno decimo post
  obitum Honorii, cum ad Chunnorum gentem cui tunc Rugila præerat, post
  prælium cum Bonifacio se Ætius contulisset, impetrato auxilio ad
  Romanorum solum regreditur.</i> And in the second book: <i>Ætio &amp;
  Valerio Coss. Ætius depositâ potestate profugus ad Hunnos in Pannonia
  pervenit, quorum amicitiâ auxilioque usus, pacem principum interpellatæ
  potestatis obtinuit.</i> Hereby it appears that at this time
  <i>Rugila</i>, or as <i>Maximus</i> calls him, <i>Rechilla</i>, reigned
  over the <i>Hunns</i> in <i>Pannonia</i>; and that <i>Pannonia</i> was
  not now so much as accounted within the soil of the Empire, being
  formerly granted away to the <i>Hunns</i>; and that these were the very
  same body of <i>Hunns</i> with which <i>Ætius</i> had, in the time of his
  being an hostage, contracted friendship: by virtue of which, as he
  sollicited them before to the aid of <i>John</i> the Tyrant A.C. 424, so
  now he procured their intercession for himself with the Emperor.
  <i>Octar</i> died A.C. 430; for <i>Socrates</i> tells us, that about that
  time the <i>Burgundians</i> having been newly vext by the <i>Hunns</i>,
  upon intelligence of <i>Octar</i>'s death, seeing them without a leader,
  set upon them suddenly with so much vigour, that 3000 <i>Burgundians</i>
  slew 10000 <i>Hunns</i>. Of <i>Rugila</i>'s being now King in
  <i>Pannonia</i> you have heard already. He died A.C. 433, and was
  succeeded by <i>Bleda</i>, as <i>Prosper</i> and <i>Maximus</i> inform
  us. This <i>Bleda</i> with his brother <i>Attila</i> were before this
  time Kings of the <i>Hunns</i> beyond the <i>Danube</i>, their father
  <i>Munzuc</i>'s kingdom being divided between them; and now they united
  the kingdom <i>Pannonia</i> to their own. Whence <i>Paulus Diaconus</i>
  saith, they did <i>regnum intra Pannoniam Daciamque gerere</i>. In the
  year 441, they began to invade the Empire afresh, adding to the
  <i>Pannonian</i> forces new and great armies from <i>Scythia</i>. But
  this war was presently composed, and then <i>Attila</i>, seeing
  <i>Bleda</i> inclined to peace, slew him, A.C. 444, inherited his
  dominions, and invaded the Empire again. At length, after various great
  wars with the <i>Romans</i>, <i>Attila</i> perished A.C. 454; and his
  sons quarrelling about his dominions, gave occasion to the
  <i>Gepides</i>, <i>Ostrogoths</i> and other nations who were their
  subjects, to rebel and make war upon them. The same year the
  <i>Ostrogoths</i> had seats granted them in <i>Pannonia</i> by the
  Emperors <i>Marcian</i> and <i>Valentinian</i>; and with the
  <i>Romans</i> ejected the <i>Hunns</i> out of <i>Pannonia</i>, soon after
  the death of <i>Attila</i>, as all historians agree. This ejection was in
  the reign of <i>Avitus</i>, as is mentioned in the <i>Chronicum
  Boiorum</i>, and in <i>Sidonius, Carm. 7 in Avitum</i>, which speaks thus
  of that Emperor.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&mdash;&mdash;<i>Cujus solum amissas post sæcula multa</i></p>
      <p><i>Pannonias revocavit iter, jam credere promptum est.</i></p>
      <p><i>Quid faciet bellis.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The Poet means, that by the coming of <i>Avitus</i> the <i>Hunns</i>
  yielded more easily to the <i>Goths</i>. This was written by
  <i>Sidonius</i> in the beginning of the reign of <i>Avitus</i>: and his
  reign began in the end of the year 455, and lasted not one full year.</p>

  <p><i>Jornandes</i> tells us: <i>Duodecimo anno regni Valiæ, quando &amp;
  Hunni post pene quinquaginta annos invasa Pannonia, à Romanis &amp;
  Gothis expulsi sunt.</i> And <i>Marcellinus</i>: <i>Hierio &amp;
  Ardaburio Coss. Pannoniæ, quæ per quinquaginta annos ab Hunnis
  retinebantur, à Romanis receptæ sunt</i>: whence it should seem that the
  <i>Hunns</i> invaded and held <i>Pannonia</i> from the year 378 or 379 to
  the year 427, and then were driven out of it. But this is a plain
  mistake: for it is certain that the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i> left the
  Empire entire; and we have shewed out of <i>Prosper</i>, that the
  <i>Hunns</i> were in quiet possession of <i>Pannonia</i> in the year 432.
  The <i>Visigoths</i> in those days had nothing to do with
  <i>Pannonia</i>, and the <i>Ostrogoths</i> continued subject to the
  <i>Hunns</i> till the death of <i>Attila</i>, A.C. 454; and <i>Valia</i>
  King of the <i>Visigoths</i> did not reign twelve years. He began his
  reign in the end of the year 415, reigned three years, and was slain A.C.
  419, as <i>Idacius</i>, <i>Isidorus</i>, and the <i>Spanish</i>
  manuscript Chronicles seen by <i>Grotius</i> testify. And
  <i>Olympiodorus</i>, who carries his history only to the year 425, sets
  down therein the death of <i>Valia</i> King of the <i>Visigoths</i>, and
  conjoins it with that of <i>Constantius</i> which happened A.C. 420.
  Wherefore the <i>Valia</i> of <i>Jornandes</i>, who reigned at the least
  twelve years, is some other King. And I suspect that this name hath been
  put by mistake for <i>Valamir</i> King of the <i>Ostrogoths</i>: for the
  action recorded was of the <i>Romans</i> and <i>Ostrogoths</i> driving
  the <i>Hunns</i> out of <i>Pannonia</i> after the death of <i>Attila</i>;
  and it is not likely that the historian would refer the history of the
  <i>Ostrogoths</i> to the years of the <i>Visigothic</i> Kings. This
  action happened in the end of the year 455, which I take to be the
  twelfth year of <i>Valamir</i> in <i>Pannonia</i>, and which was almost
  fifty years after the year 406, in which the <i>Hunns</i> succeeded the
  <i>Vandals</i> and <i>Alans</i> in <i>Pannonia</i>. Upon the ceasing of
  the line of <i>Hunnimund</i> the son of <i>Hermaneric</i>, the
  <i>Ostrogoths</i> lived without Kings of their own nation about forty
  years together, being subject to the <i>Hunns</i>. And when <i>Alaric</i>
  began to make war upon the <i>Romans</i>, which was in the year 444, he
  made <i>Valamir</i>, with his brothers <i>Theodomir</i> and
  <i>Videmir</i> the grandsons of <i>Vinethar</i>, captains or kings of
  these <i>Ostrogoths</i> under him. In the twelfth year of
  <i>Valamir</i>'s reign dated from thence, the <i>Hunns</i> were driven
  out of <i>Pannonia</i>.</p>

  <p>Yet the <i>Hunns</i> were not so ejected, but that they had further
  contests with the <i>Romans</i>, till the head of <i>Denfix</i> the son
  of <i>Attila</i>, was carried to <i>Constantinople</i>, A.C. 469, in the
  Consulship of <i>Zeno</i> and <i>Marcian</i>, as <i>Marcellinus</i>
  relates. Nor were they yet totally ejected the Empire: for besides their
  reliques in <i>Pannonia</i>, <i>Sigonius</i> tells us, that when the
  Emperors <i>Marcian</i> and <i>Valentinian</i> granted <i>Pannonia</i> to
  the <i>Goths</i>, which was in the year 454, they granted part of
  <i>Illyricum</i> to some of the <i>Hunns</i> and <i>Sarmatians</i>. And
  in the year 526, when the <i>Lombards</i> removing into <i>Pannonia</i>
  made war there with the <i>Gepides</i>, the <i>Avares</i>, a part of the
  <i>Hunns</i>, who had taken the name of <i>Avares</i> from one of their
  Kings, assisted the <i>Lombards</i> in that war; and the <i>Lombards</i>
  afterwards, when they went into <i>Italy</i>, left their seats in
  <i>Pannonia</i> to the <i>Avares</i> in recompence of their friendship.
  From that time the <i>Hunns</i> grew again very powerful; their Kings,
  whom they called <i>Chagan</i>, troubling the Empire much in the reigns
  of the Emperors <i>Mauritius</i>, <i>Phocas</i>, and <i>Heraclius</i>:
  and this is the original of the present kingdom of <i>Hungary</i>, which
  from these <i>Avares</i> and other <i>Hunns</i> mixed together, took the
  name of <i>Hun-Avaria</i>, and by contraction <i>Hungary</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_9">9</a>. The <i>Lombards</i>, before they came over
  the <i>Danube</i>, were commanded by two captains, <i>Ibor</i> and
  <i>Ayon</i>: after whose death they had Kings, <i>Agilmund</i>,
  <i>Lamisso</i>, <i>Lechu</i>, <i>Hildehoc</i>, <i>Gudehoc</i>,
  <i>Classo</i>, <i>Tato</i>, <i>Wacho</i>, <i>Walter</i>, <i>Audoin</i>,
  <i>Alboin</i>, <i>Cleophis</i>, &amp;c. <i>Agilmund</i> was the son of
  <i>Ayon</i>, who became their King, according to <i>Prosper</i>, in the
  Consulship of <i>Honorius</i> and <i>Theodosius</i> A.C. 389, reigned
  thirty three years, according to <i>Paulus Warnefridus</i>, and was slain
  in battle by the <i>Bulgarians</i>. <i>Prosper</i> places his death in
  the Consulship of <i>Marinianus</i> and <i>Asclepiodorus</i>, A.C. 413.
  <i>Lamisso</i> routed the <i>Bulgarians</i>, and reigned three years, and
  <i>Lechu</i> almost forty. <i>Gudehoc</i> was contemporary to
  <i>Odoacer</i> King of the <i>Heruli</i> in <i>Italy</i>, and led his
  people from <i>Pannonia</i> into <i>Rugia</i>, a country on the north
  side of <i>Noricum</i> next beyond the <i>Danube</i>; from whence
  <i>Odoacer</i> then carried his people into <i>Italy</i>. <i>Tato</i>
  overthrew the kingdom of the <i>Heruli</i> beyond the <i>Danube</i>.
  <i>Wacho</i> conquered the <i>Suevians</i>, a kingdom then bounded on the
  east by <i>Bavaria</i>, on the west by <i>France</i>, and on the south by
  the <i>Burgundians</i>. <i>Audoin</i> returned into <i>Pannonia</i> A.C.
  526, and there overcame the <i>Gepides</i>. <i>Alboin</i> A.C. 551
  overthrew the kingdom of the <i>Gepides</i>, and slew their King
  <i>Chunnimund</i>: A.C. 563 he assisted the <i>Greek</i> Emperor against
  <i>Totila</i> King of the <i>Ostrogoths</i> in <i>Italy</i>; and A.C. 568
  led his people out of <i>Pannonia</i> into <i>Lombardy</i>, where they
  reigned till the year 774.</p>

  <p>According to <i>Paulus Diaconus</i>, the <i>Lombards</i> with many
  other <i>Gothic</i> nations came into the Empire from beyond the
  <i>Danube</i> in the reign of <i>Arcadius</i> and <i>Honorius</i>, that
  is, between the years 395 and 408. But they might come in a little
  earlier: for we are told that the <i>Lombards</i>, under their captains
  <i>Ibor</i> and <i>Ayon</i>, beat the <i>Vandals</i> in battle; and
  <i>Prosper</i> placeth this victory in the Consulship of <i>Ausonius</i>
  and <i>Olybrius</i>, that is, A.C. 379. Before this war the
  <i>Vandals</i> had remained quiet forty years in the seats granted them
  in <i>Pannonia</i> by <i>Constantine</i> the great. And therefore if
  these were the same <i>Vandals</i>, this war must have been in
  <i>Pannonia</i>; and might be occasioned by the coming of the
  <i>Lombards</i> over the <i>Danube</i> into <i>Pannonia</i>, a year or
  two before the battle; and so have put an end to that quiet which had
  lasted forty years. After <i>Gratian</i> and <i>Theodosius</i> had
  quieted the <i>Barbarians</i>, they might either retire over the
  <i>Danube</i>, or continue quiet under the <i>Romans</i> till the death
  of <i>Theodosius</i>; and then either invade the Empire anew, or throw
  off all subjection to it. By their wars, first with the <i>Vandals</i>,
  and then with the <i>Bulgarians</i>, a <i>Scythian</i> nation so called
  from the river <i>Volga</i> whence they came; it appears that even in
  those days they were a kingdom not contemptible.</p>

  <p><a name="DanVI_10">10</a>. These nine kingdoms being rent away, we are
  next to consider the residue of the <i>Western Empire</i>. While this
  Empire continued entire, it was the Beast itself: but the residue thereof
  is only a part of it. Now if this part be considered as a horn, the reign
  of this horn may be dated from the translation of the imperial seat from
  <i>Rome</i> to <i>Ravenna</i>, which was in <i>October</i> A.C. 408. For
  then the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>, fearing that <i>Alaric</i> would
  besiege him in <i>Rome</i>, if he staid there, retired to <i>Millain</i>,
  and thence to <i>Ravenna</i>: and the ensuing siege and sacking of
  <i>Rome</i> confirmed his residence there, so that he and his successors
  ever after made it their home. Accordingly <i>Macchiavel</i> in his
  <i>Florentine</i> history writes, that <i>Valentinian</i> having left
  <i>Rome</i>, translated the seat of the Empire to <i>Ravenna</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Rhætia</i> belonged to the <i>Western</i> Emperors, so long as that
  Empire stood; and then it descended, with <i>Italy</i> and the
  <i>Roman</i> Senate, to <i>Odoacer</i> King of the <i>Heruli</i> in
  <i>Italy</i>, and after him to <i>Theoderic</i> King of the
  <i>Ostrogoths</i> and his successors, by the grant of the <i>Greek</i>
  Emperors. Upon the death of <i>Valentinian</i> the second, the
  <i>Alemans</i> and <i>Suevians</i> invaded <i>Rhætia</i> A.C. 455. But I
  do not find they erected any settled kingdom there: for in the year 457,
  while they were yet depopulating <i>Rhætia</i>, they were attacked and
  beaten by <i>Burto</i> Master of the horse to the Emperor
  <i>Majoranus</i>; and I hear nothing more of their invading
  <i>Rhætia</i>. <i>Clodovæus</i> King of <i>France</i>, in or about the
  year 496, conquered a kingdom of the <i>Alemans</i>, and slew their last
  King <i>Ermeric</i>. But this kingdom was seated in <i>Germany</i>, and
  only bordered upon <i>Rhætia</i>: for its people fled from
  <i>Clodovæus</i> into the neighbouring kingdom of the <i>Ostrogoths</i>
  under <i>Theoderic</i>, who received them as friends, and wrote a
  friendly letter to <i>Clodovæus</i> in their behalf: and by this means
  they became inhabitants of <i>Rhætia</i>, as subjects under the dominion
  of the <i>Ostrogoths</i>.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Greek</i> Emperor conquered the <i>Ostrogoths</i>, he
  succeeded them in the kingdom of <i>Ravenna</i>, not only by right of
  conquest but also by right of inheritance, the <i>Roman</i> Senate still
  going along with this kingdom. Therefore we may reckon that this kingdom
  continued in the Exarchate of <i>Ravenna</i> and Senate of <i>Rome</i>:
  for the remainder of the <i>Western Empire</i> went along with the Senate
  of <i>Rome</i>, by reason of the right which this Senate still retained,
  and at length exerted, of chusing a new <i>Western</i> Emperor.</p>

  <p>I have now enumerated the ten kingdoms, into which the <i>Western
  Empire</i> became divided at its first breaking, that is, at the time of
  <i>Rome</i>'s being besieged and taken by the <i>Goths</i>. Some of these
  kingdoms at length fell, and new ones arose: but whatever was their
  number afterwards, they are still called the <i>Ten Kings</i> from their
  first number.</p>

  above; and therefore the little horn is a little kingdom. It was a horn
  of the fourth Beast, and rooted up three of his first horns; and
  therefore we are to look for it among the nations of the <i>Latin</i>
  Empire, after the rise of the ten horns. But it was a kingdom of a
  different kind from the other ten kingdoms, having a life or soul
  peculiar to itself, with eyes and a mouth. By its eyes it was a Seer; and
  by its mouth speaking great things and changing times and laws, it was a
  Prophet as well as a King. And such a Seer, a Prophet and a King, is the
  Church of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

  <p>A Seer, <span lang="el" title="Episkopos"
  >&#x395;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  is a Bishop in the literal sense of the word; and this Church claims the
  universal Bishoprick.</p>

  <p>With his mouth he gives laws to kings and nations as an Oracle; and
  pretends to Infallibility, and that his dictates are binding to the whole
  world; which is to be a Prophet in the highest degree.</p>

  <p>In the eighth century, by rooting up and subduing the Exarchate of
  <i>Ravenna</i>, the kingdom of the <i>Lombards</i>, and the Senate and
  Dukedom of <i>Rome</i>, he acquired <i>Peter</i>'s Patrimony out of their
  dominions; and thereby rose up as a temporal Prince or King, or horn of
  the fourth Beast.</p>

  <p>In a small book printed at <i>Paris</i> A.C. 1689, entitled, <i>An
  historical dissertation upon some coins of </i>Charles<i> the great,
  </i>Ludovicus Pius<i>, </i>Lotharius<i>, and their successors stamped at
  </i>Rome, it is recorded, that in the days of Pope <i>Leo</i> X, there
  was remaining in the <i>Vatican</i>, and till those days exposed to
  public view, an inscription in honour of <i>Pipin</i> the father of
  <i>Charles</i> the great, in these words: <i>Pipinum pium, primum fuisse
  qui amplificandæ Ecclesiæ Romanæ viam aperuerit, Exarchatu Ravennate,
  &amp; plurimis aliis oblatis</i>; "That <i>Pipin</i> the pious was the
  first who opened a way to the grandeur of the Church of <i>Rome</i>,
  conferring upon her the Exarchate of <i>Ravenna</i> and many other
  oblations." In and before the reign of the Emperors <i>Gratian</i> and
  <i>Theodosius</i>, the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> lived splendidly; but this
  was by the oblations of the <i>Roman</i> Ladies, as <i>Ammianus</i>
  describes. After those reigns <i>Italy</i> was invaded by foreign
  nations, and did not get rid of her troubles before the fall of the
  kingdom of <i>Lombardy</i>. It was certainly by the victory of the see of
  <i>Rome</i> over the <i>Greek</i> Emperor, the King of <i>Lombardy</i>,
  and the Senate of <i>Rome</i>, that she acquired <i>Peter</i>'s
  Patrimony, and rose up to her greatness. The donation of
  <i>Constantine</i> the Great is a fiction, and so is the donation of the
  <i>Alpes Cottiæ</i> to the Pope by <i>Aripert</i> King of the
  <i>Lombards</i>: for the <i>Alpes Cottiæ</i> were a part of the
  Exarchate, and in the days of <i>Aripert</i> belonged to the <i>Greek</i>
  Emperor.</p>

  <p>The invocation of the dead, and veneration of their images, being
  gradually introduced in the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, the
  <i>Greek</i> Emperor <i>Philippicus</i> declared against the latter, A.C.
  711 or 712. And <a name="NtpDanVII_5"
  href="#NtDanVII_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> the Emperor <i>Leo Isaurus</i>, to
  put a stop to it, called a meeting of Counsellors and Bishops in his
  Palace, A.C. 726; and by their advice put out an Edict against that
  worship, and wrote to Pope <i>Gregory</i> II. that a general Council
  might be called. But the Pope thereupon called a Council at <i>Rome</i>,
  confirmed the worship of Images, excommunicated the <i>Greek</i> Emperor,
  absolved the people from their allegiance, and forbad them to pay
  tribute, or otherwise be obedient to him. Then the people of <i>Rome</i>,
  <i>Campania</i>, <i>Ravenna</i> and <i>Pentapolis</i>, with the cities
  under them, revolted and laid violent hands upon their magistrates,
  killing the Exarch <i>Paul</i> at <i>Ravenna</i>, and laying aside
  <i>Peter</i> Duke of <i>Rome</i> who was become blind: and when
  <i>Exhileratus</i> Duke of <i>Campania</i> incited the people against the
  Pope, the <i>Romans</i> invaded <i>Campania</i>, and slew him with his
  son <i>Hadrian</i>. Then a new Exarch, <i>Eutychius</i>, coming to
  <i>Naples</i>, sent some secretly to take away the lives of the Pope and
  the Nobles of <i>Rome</i>: but the plot being discovered, the
  <i>Romans</i> revolted absolutely from the <i>Greek</i> Emperor, and took
  an oath to preserve the life of the Pope, to defend his state, and be
  obedient to his authority in all things. Thus <i>Rome</i> with its Duchy,
  including part of <i>Tuscany</i> and part of <i>Campania</i>, revolted in
  the year 726, and became a free state under the government of the Senate
  of this city. The authority of the Senate in civil affairs was
  henceforward absolute, the authority of the Pope extending hitherto no
  farther than to the affairs of the Church only.</p>

  <p>At that time <a name="NtpDanVII_6"
  href="#NtDanVII_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> the <i>Lombards</i> also being
  zealous for the worship of images, and pretending to favour the cause of
  the Pope, invaded the cities of the Exarchate: and at length, <i>viz.</i>
  A.C. 752, took <i>Ravenna</i>, and put an end to the Exarchate. And this
  was the first of the three kingdoms which fell before the little
  horn.</p>

  <p>In the year 751 <a name="NtpDanVII_7"
  href="#NtDanVII_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Pope <i>Zechary</i> deposed
  <i>Childeric</i>, a slothful and useless King of <i>France</i>, and the
  last of the race of <i>Merovæus</i>; and absolving his subjects from
  their oath of allegiance, gave the kingdom to <i>Pipin</i> the major of
  the Palace; and thereby made a new and potent friend. His successor <a
  name="NtpDanVII_8" href="#NtDanVII_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Pope
  <i>Stephen</i> III, knowing better how to deal with the <i>Greek</i>
  Emperor than with the <i>Lombards</i>, went the next year to the King of
  the <i>Lombards</i>, to persuade him to return the Exarchate to the
  Emperor. But this not succeeding, he went into <i>France</i>, and
  persuaded <i>Pipin</i> to take the Exarchate and <i>Pentapolis</i> from
  the <i>Lombards</i>, and give it to St. <i>Peter</i>. Accordingly
  <i>Pipin</i> A.C. 754 came with an army into <i>Italy</i>, and made
  <i>Aistulphus</i> King of the <i>Lombards</i> promise the surrender: but
  the next year <i>Aistulphus</i>, on the contrary, to revenge himself on
  the Pope, besieged the city of <i>Rome</i>. Whereupon the Pope sent
  letters to <i>Pipin</i>, wherein he told him that if he came not speedily
  against the <i>Lombards</i>, <i>pro data sibi potentia, alienandum fore à
  regno Dei &amp; vita æterna</i>, he should be excommunicated.
  <i>Pipin</i> therefore, fearing a revolt of his subjects, and being
  indebted to the Church of <i>Rome</i>, came speedily with an army into
  <i>Italy</i>, raised the siege, besieged the <i>Lombards</i> in
  <i>Pavia</i>, and forced them to surrender the Exarchate and region of
  <i>Pentapolis</i> to the Pope for a perpetual possession. Thus the Pope
  became Lord of <i>Ravenna</i>, and the Exarchate, some few cities
  excepted; and the keys were sent to <i>Rome</i>, and laid upon the
  confession of St. <i>Peter</i>, that is, upon his tomb at the high Altar,
  <i>in signum veri perpetuique dominii, sed pietate Regis gratuita</i>, as
  the inscription of a coin of <i>Pipin</i> hath it. This was in the year
  of Christ 755. And henceforward the Popes being temporal Princes, left
  off in their Epistles and Bulls to note the years of the <i>Greek</i>
  Emperors, as they had hitherto done.</p>

  <p>After this <a name="NtpDanVII_9" href="#NtDanVII_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
  the <i>Lombards</i> invading the Pope's countries, Pope <i>Adrian</i>
  sent to <i>Charles</i> the great, the son and successor of <i>Pipin</i>,
  to come to his assistance. Accordingly <i>Charles</i> entered
  <i>Italy</i> with an army, invaded the <i>Lombards</i>, overthrew their
  kingdom, became master of their countries, and restored to the Pope, not
  only what they had taken from him, but also the rest of the Exarchate
  which they had promised <i>Pipin</i> to surrender to him, but had
  hitherto detained; and also gave him some cities of the <i>Lombards</i>,
  and was in return himself made <i>Patricius</i> by the <i>Romans</i>, and
  had the authority of confirming the elections of the Popes conferred upon
  him. These things were done in the years 773 and 774. This kingdom of the
  <i>Lombards</i> was the second kingdom which fell before the little horn.
  But <i>Rome</i>, which was to be the seat of his kingdom, was not yet his
  own.</p>

  <p>In the year 796, <a name="NtpDanVII_10"
  href="#NtDanVII_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> <i>Leo</i> III being made Pope,
  notified his election to <i>Charles</i> the great by his Legates, sending
  to him for a present, the golden keys of the Confession of <i>Peter</i>,
  and the Banner of the city of <i>Rome</i>: the first as an acknowledgment
  of the Pope's holding the cities of the Exarchate and <i>Lombardy</i> by
  the grant of <i>Charles</i>; the other as a signification that
  <i>Charles</i> should come and subdue the Senate and people of
  <i>Rome</i>, as he had done the Exarchate and the kingdom of the
  <i>Lombards</i>. For the Pope at the same time desired <i>Charles</i> to
  send some of his Princes to <i>Rome</i>, who might subject the
  <i>Roman</i> people to him, and bind them by oath <i>in fide &amp;
  subjectione</i>, in fealty and subjection, as his words are recited by
  <i>Sigonius</i>. An anonymous Poet, publish'd by <i>Boeclerus</i> at
  <i>Strasburg</i>, expresseth it thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Admonuitque piis precibus, qui mittere vellet</i></p>
      <p><i>Ex propriis aliquos primoribus, ac sibi plebem</i></p>
      <p><i>Subdere Romanam, servandaque f&#339;dera cogens</i></p>
      <p><i>Hanc fidei sacramentis promittere magnis</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Hence arose a misunderstanding between the Pope and the city: and the
  <i>Romans</i> about two or three years after, by assistance of some of
  the Clergy, raised such tumults against him, as gave occasion to a new
  state of things in all the <i>West</i>. For two of the Clergy accused him
  of crimes, and the <i>Romans</i> with an armed force, seized him, stript
  him of his sacerdotal habit, and imprisoned him in a monastery. But by
  assistance of his friends he made his escape, and fled into
  <i>Germany</i> to <i>Charles</i> the great, to whom he complained of the
  <i>Romans</i> for acting against him out of a design to throw off all
  authority of the Church, and to recover their antient freedom. In his
  absence his accusers with their forces ravaged the possessions of the
  Church, and sent the accusations to <i>Charles</i>; who before the end of
  the year sent the Pope back to <i>Rome</i> with a large retinue. The
  Nobles and Bishops of <i>France</i> who accompanied him, examined the
  chief of his accusers at <i>Rome</i>, and sent them into <i>France</i> in
  custody. This was in the year 799. The next year <i>Charles</i> himself
  went to <i>Rome</i>, and upon a day appointed presided in a Council of
  <i>Italian</i> and <i>French</i> Bishops to hear both parties. But when
  the Pope's adversaries expected to be heard, the Council declared <a
  name="NtpDanVII_11" href="#NtDanVII_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> that he who
  was the supreme judge of all men, was above being judged by any other
  than himself: whereupon he made a solemn declaration of his innocence
  before all the people, and by doing so was looked upon as acquitted.</p>

  <p>Soon after, upon <i>Christmas</i>-day, the people of <i>Rome</i>, who
  had hitherto elected their Bishop, and reckoned that they and their
  Senate inherited the rights of the antient Senate and people of
  <i>Rome</i>, voted <i>Charles</i> their Emperor, and subjected themselves
  to him in such manner as the old <i>Roman</i> Empire and their Senate
  were subjected to the old <i>Roman</i> Emperors. The Pope crowned him,
  and anointed him with holy oil, and worshipped him on his knees after the
  manner of adoring the old <i>Roman</i> Emperors; as the aforesaid Poet
  thus relates:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Post laudes igitur dictas &amp; summus eundem</i></p>
      <p><i>Præsul adoravit, sicut mos debitus olim</i></p>
      <p><i>Principibus fuit antiquis</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The Emperor, on the other hand, took the following oath to the Pope:
  <i>In nomine Christi spondeo atque polliceor, Ego Carolus Imperator coram
  Deo &amp; beato Petro Apostolo, me protectorem ac defensorem fore hujus
  sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ in omnibus utilitatibus, quatenùs divino fultus
  fuero adjutorio, prout sciero poteroque</i>. The Emperor was also made
  Consul of <i>Rome</i>, and his son <i>Pipin</i> crowned King of
  <i>Italy</i>: and henceforward the Emperor stiled himself: <i>Carolus
  serenissimus, Augustus, à Deo coronatus, magnus, pacificus, Romæ
  gubernans imperium</i>, or <i>Imperator Romanorum</i>; and was prayed for
  in the Churches of <i>Rome</i>. His image was henceforward put upon the
  coins of <i>Rome</i>: while the enemies of the Pope, to the number of
  three hundred <i>Romans</i> and two or three of the Clergy, were
  sentenced to death. The three hundred <i>Romans</i> were beheaded in one
  day in the <i>Lateran</i> fields: but the Clergymen at the intercession
  of the Pope were pardoned, and banished into <i>France</i>. And thus the
  title of <i>Roman</i> Emperor, which had hitherto been in the
  <i>Greek</i> Emperors, was by this act transferred in the <i>West</i> to
  the Kings of <i>France</i>.</p>

  <p>After these things <a name="NtpDanVII_12"
  href="#NtDanVII_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> <i>Charles</i> gave the City and
  Duchy of <i>Rome</i> to the Pope, subordinately to himself as Emperor of
  the <i>Romans</i>; spent the winter in ordering the affairs of
  <i>Rome</i>, and those of the Apostolic see, and of all <i>Italy</i>,
  both civil and ecclesiastical, and in making new laws for them; and
  returned the next summer into <i>France</i>: leaving the city under its
  Senate, and both under the Pope and himself. But hearing that his new
  laws were not observed by the judges in dictating the law, nor by the
  people in hearing it; and that the great men took servants from free men,
  and from the Churches and Monasteries, to labour in their vineyards,
  fields, pastures and houses, and continued to exact cattle and wine of
  them, and to oppress those that served the Churches: he wrote to his son
  <i>Pipin</i> to remedy these abuses, to take care of the Church, and see
  his laws executed.</p>

  <p>Now the Senate and people and principality of <i>Rome</i> I take to be
  the third King the little horn overcame, and even the chief of the three.
  For this people elected the Pope and the Emperor; and now, by electing
  the Emperor and making him Consul, was acknowledged to retain the
  authority of the old <i>Roman</i> Senate and people. This city was the
  Metropolis of the old <i>Roman</i> Empire, represented in <i>Daniel</i>
  by the fourth Beast; and by subduing the Senate and people and Duchy, it
  became the Metropolis of the little horn of that Beast, and completed
  <i>Peter</i>'s Patrimony, which was the kingdom of that horn. Besides,
  this victory was attended with greater consequences than those over the
  other two Kings. For it set up the <i>Western Empire</i>, which continues
  to this day. It set up the Pope above the judicature of the <i>Roman</i>
  Senate, and above that of a Council of <i>Italian</i> and <i>French</i>
  Bishops, and even above all human judicature; and gave him the supremacy
  over the <i>Western</i> Churches and their Councils in a high degree. It
  gave him <i>a look more stout than his fellows</i>; so that when this new
  religion began to be established in the minds of men, he grappled not
  only with Kings, but even with the <i>Western</i> Emperor himself. It is
  observable also, that the custom of kissing the Pope's feet, an honour
  superior to that of Kings and Emperors, began about this time. There are
  some instances of it in the ninth century: <i>Platina</i> tells us, that
  the feet of Pope <i>Leo</i> IV were kissed, according to antient custom,
  by all who came to him: and some say that <i>Leo</i> III began this
  custom, pretending that his hand was infected by the kiss of a woman. The
  Popes began also about this time to canonize saints, and to grant
  indulgences and pardons: and some represent that <i>Leo</i> III was the
  first author of all these things. It is further observable, that
  <i>Charles</i> the great, between the years 775 and 796, conquered all
  <i>Germany</i> from the <i>Rhine</i> and <i>Danube</i> northward to the
  <i>Baltic</i> sea, and eastward to the river <i>Teis</i>; extending his
  conquests also into <i>Spain</i> as far as the river <i>Ebro</i>: and by
  these conquests he laid the foundation of the new Empire; and at the same
  time propagated the <i>Roman</i> Catholic religion into all his
  conquests, obliging the <i>Saxons</i> and <i>Hunns</i> who were heathens,
  to receive the <i>Roman</i> faith, and distributing his northern
  conquests into Bishopricks, granting tithes to the Clergy and
  <i>Peter-pence</i> to the Pope: by all which the Church of <i>Rome</i>
  was highly enlarged, enriched, exalted, and established.</p>

  <p>In the forementioned <i>dissertation upon some coins of </i>Charles<i>
  the great, </i>Ludovicus Pius<i>, </i>Lotharius<i>, and their successors,
  stamped at </i>Rome, there is a draught of a piece of <i>Mosaic</i> work
  which Pope <i>Leo</i> III. caused to be made in his Palace near the
  Church of <i>John Lateran</i>, in memory of his sending the standard or
  banner of the city of <i>Rome</i> curiously wrought, to <i>Charles</i>
  the great; and which still remained there at the publishing of the said
  book. In the <i>Mosaic</i> work there appeared <i>Peter</i> with three
  keys in his lap, reaching the <i>Pallium</i> to the Pope with his right
  hand, and the banner of the city to <i>Charles</i> the great with his
  left. By the Pope was this inscription, SCISSIMUS D.N. LEO PP; by the
  King this, D.N. CARVLO REGI; and under the feet of <i>Peter</i> this,
  BEATE PETRE, DONA VITAM LEONI PP, ET BICTORIAM CARVLO REGI DONA. This
  Monument gives the title of King to <i>Charles</i>, and therefore was
  erected before he was Emperor. It was erected when <i>Peter</i> was
  reaching the <i>Pallium</i> to the Pope, and the Pope was sending the
  banner of the city to <i>Charles</i>, that is, A.C. 796. The words above,
  <i>Sanctissimus Dominus noster Leo Papa Domino nostro Carolo Regi</i>,
  relate to the message; and the words below, <i>Beate Petre, dona vitam
  Leoni Papæ &amp; victoriam Carolo regi dona</i>, are a prayer that in
  this undertaking God would preserve the life of the Pope, and give
  victory to the King over the <i>Romans</i>. The three keys in the lap of
  <i>Peter</i> signify the keys of the three parts of his Patrimony, that
  of <i>Rome</i> with its Duchy, which the Pope claimed and was conquering,
  those of <i>Ravenna</i> with the Exarchate, and of the territories taken
  from the <i>Lombards</i>; both which he had newly conquered. These were
  the three dominions, whose keys were in the lap of St. <i>Peter</i>, and
  whose Crowns are now worn by the Pope, and by the conquest of which he
  became the little horn of the fourth Beast. By <i>Peter</i>'s giving the
  <i>Pallium</i> to the Pope with his right hand, and the banner of the
  city to the King with his left, and by naming the Pope before the King in
  the inscription, may be understood that the Pope was then reckoned
  superior in dignity to the Kings of the earth.</p>

  <p>After the death of <i>Charles</i> the great, his son and successor
  <i>Ludovicus Pius</i>, at the request of the Pope, <a name="NtpDanVII_13"
  href="#NtDanVII_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> confirmed the donations of his
  grandfather and father to the see of <i>Rome</i>. And in the confirmation
  he names first <i>Rome</i> with its Duchy extending into <i>Tuscany</i>
  and <i>Campania</i>; then the Exarchate of <i>Ravenna</i>, with
  <i>Pentapolis</i>; and in the third place, the territories taken from the
  <i>Lombards</i>. These are his three conquests, and he was to hold them
  of the Emperor for the use of the Church <i>sub integritate</i>,
  entirely, without the Emperor's medling therewith, or with the
  jurisdiction or power of the Pope therein, unless called thereto in
  certain cases. This ratification the Emperor <i>Ludovicus</i> made under
  an oath: and as the King of the <i>Ostrogoths</i>, for acknowledging that
  he held his kingdom of <i>Italy</i> of the <i>Greek</i> Emperor, stamped
  the effigies of the Emperor on one side of his coins and his own on the
  reverse; so the Pope made the like acknowledgment to the <i>Western</i>
  Emperor. For the Pope began now to coin money, and the coins of
  <i>Rome</i> are henceforward found with the heads of the Emperors,
  <i>Charles</i>, <i>Ludovicus Pius</i>, <i>Lotharius</i>, and their
  successors, on the one side, and the Pope's inscription on the reverse,
  for many years.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the power of the eleventh horn of

  <p>In the reign of the <i>Greek</i> Emperor <i>Justinian</i>, and again
  in the reign of <i>Phocas</i>, the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> obtained some
  dominion over the <i>Greek</i> Churches, but of no long continuance. His
  standing dominion was only over the nations of the <i>Western Empire</i>,
  represented by <i>Daniel</i>'s fourth Beast. And this jurisdiction was
  set up by the following Edict of the Emperors <i>Gratian</i> and
  <i>Valentinian.&mdash;<a name="NtpDanVIII_1"

  sine delatione contendat.&mdash;&mdash;Quod si vel Metropolitani Episcopi
  vel cujuscunque sacerdotis iniquitas est suspecta, aut gratia; ad Romanum
  Episcopum, vel ad Concilium quindecim finitimorum Episcoporum accersitum
  liceat provocare; modo ne post examen habitum, quod definitum fuerit,
  integretur</i>. This Edict wanting the name of both <i>Valens</i> and
  <i>Theodosius</i> in the Title, was made in the time between their
  reigns, that is, in the end of the year 378, or the beginning of 379. It
  was directed to the <i>Præfecti Prætorio Italiæ &amp; Galliæ</i>, and
  therefore was general. For the <i>Præfectus Prætorio Italiæ</i> governed
  <i>Italy</i>, <i>Illyricum occidentale</i> and <i>Africa</i>; and the
  <i>Præfectus Prætorio Galliæ</i> governed <i>Gallia</i>, <i>Spain</i>,
  and <i>Britain</i>.</p>

  <p>The granting of this jurisdiction to the Pope gave several Bishops
  occasion to write to him for his resolutions upon doubtful cases,
  whereupon he answered by decretal Epistles; and henceforward he gave laws
  to the <i>Western</i> Churches by such Epistles. <i>Himerius</i> Bishop
  of <i>Tarraco</i>, the head city of a province in <i>Spain</i>, writing
  to Pope <i>Damasus</i> for his direction about certain Ecclesiastical
  matters, and the Letter not arriving at <i>Rome</i> till after the death
  of <i>Damasus</i>, A.C. 384; his successor <i>Siricius</i> answered the
  same with a legislative authority, telling him of one thing: <i>Cum hoc
  fieri&mdash;missa ad Provincias à venerandæ memoriæ prædecessore meo
  Liberio generalia decreta, prohibeant</i>. Of another: <i>Noverint se ab
  omni ecclesiastico honore, quo indignè usi sunt, Apostolicæ Sedis
  auctoritate, dejectos</i>. Of another: <i>Scituri posthac omnium
  Provinciarum summi Antistites, quod si ultrò ad sacros ordines quenquam
  de talibus esse assumendum, &amp; de suo &amp; de aliorum statu, quos
  contra Canones &amp; interdicta nostra provexerint, congruam ab
  Apostolica Sede promendam esse sententiam</i>. And the Epistle he
  concludes thus: <i>Explicuimus, ut arbitror, frater charissime, universa
  quæ digesta sunt in querelam; &amp; ad singulas causas, de quibus ad
  Romanam Ecclesiam, utpote ad caput tui corporis, retulisti; sufficientia,
  quantum opinor, responsa reddidimus. Nunc fraternitatis tuæ animum ad
  servandos canones, &amp; tenenda decretalia constituta, magis ac magis
  incitamus: ad hæc quæ ad tua consulta rescripsimus in omnium
  Coepiscoporum perferri facias notionem; &amp; non solum corum, qui in tua
  sunt di&#339;cesi constituti, sed etiam ad universos Carthaginenses ac
  B&#339;ticos, Lusitanos atque <a name="NtpDanVIII_2"

  ordinatione disposita, sub literarum tuarum prosecutione mittantur. Et
  quanquam statuta sedis Apostolicæ vel Canonum venerabilia definita, nulli

  nimia cautela &amp; deliberatione sunt salubriter constituta, intemerata
  permaneant, &amp; omnibus in posterum excusationibus aditus, qui jam
  nulli apud nos patere poterit, obstruatur. Dat. 3 Id. Febr. Arcadio &amp;
  Bautone viris clarissimis Consulibus</i>, A.C. 385. Pope <i>Liberius</i>
  in the reign of <i>Jovian</i> or <i>Valentinian</i> I. sent general
  Decrees to the Provinces, ordering that the <i>Arians</i> should not be
  rebaptized: and this he did in favour of the Council of
  <i>Alexandria</i>, that nothing more should be required of them than to
  renounce their opinions. Pope <i>Damasus</i> is said to have decreed in a
  <i>Roman</i> Council, that <i>Tithes</i> and <i>Tenths</i> should be paid
  upon pain of an <i>Anathema</i>; and that <i>Glory be to the Father</i>,
  &amp;c. should be said or sung at the end of the <i>Psalms</i>. But the
  first decretal Epistle now extant is this of <i>Siricius</i> to
  <i>Himerius</i>; by which the Pope made <i>Himerius</i> his Vicar over
  all <i>Spain</i> for promulging his Decrees, and seeing them observed.
  The Bishop of <i>Sevill</i> was also the Pope's Vicar sometimes; for
  <i>Simplicius</i> wrote thus to <i>Zeno</i> Bishop of that place:
  <i>Talibus idcirco gloriantes indiciis, congruum duximus vicariâ Sedis
  nostræ te auctoritate fulciri: cujus vigore munitus, Apostolicæ
  institutionis Decreta, vel sanctorum terminos Patrum, nullatenus
  transcendi permittas</i>. And Pope <i>Hormisda</i> <a name="NtpDanVIII_3"
  href="#NtDanVIII_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> made the Bishop of <i>Sevill</i>
  his Vicar over <i>B&#339;tica</i> and <i>Lusitania</i>, and the Bishop of
  <i>Tarraco</i> his Vicar over all the rest of <i>Spain</i>, as appears by
  his Epistles to them.</p>

  <p>Pope <i>Innocent</i> the first, in his decretal Epistle to
  <i>Victricius</i> Bishop of <i>Rouen</i> in <i>France</i>, A.C. 404, in
  pursuance of the Edict of <i>Gratian</i>, made this Decree: <i>Si quæ
  autem causæ vel contentiones inter Clericos tam superioris ordinis quam
  etiam inferioris fuerint exortæ; ut secundum Synodum Nicenam congregatis
  ejusdem Provinciæ Episcopis jurgium terminetur: nec alicui liceat, <a
  name="NtpDanVIII_4" href="#NtDanVIII_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Romanæ
  Ecclesiæ, cujus in omnibus causis debet reverentia custodiri, relictis
  his sacerdotibus, qui in eadem Provincia Dei Ecclesiam nutu Divino
  gubernant, ad alias convolare Provincias. Quod siquis fortè præsumpserit;
  &amp; ab officio Clericatûs summotus, &amp; injuriarum reus judicetur. Si
  autem majores causæ in medium fuerint devolutæ, ad Sedem Apostolicam
  sicut Synodus statuit, &amp; beata consuetudo exigit, post judicium
  Episcopale referantur</i>. By these Letters it seems to me that
  <i>Gallia</i> was now subject to the Pope, and had been so for some time,
  and that the Bishop of <i>Rouen</i> was then his Vicar or one of them:
  for the Pope directs him to refer the greater causes to the See of
  <i>Rome</i>, according to custom. But the Bishop of <i>Arles</i> soon
  after became the Pope's Vicar over all <i>Gallia</i>: for Pope
  <i>Zosimus</i>, A.C. 417, ordaining that none should have access to him
  without the credentials of his Vicars, conferred upon <i>Patroclus</i>
  the Bishop of <i>Arles</i> this authority over all <i>Gallia</i>, by the
  following Decree.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Zosimus universis Episcopis per Gallias &amp; septem
Provincias constitutis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Placuit Apostolicæ Sedi, ut siquis ex qualibet Galliarum parte sub
  quolibet ecclesiastico gradu ad nos Romæ venire contendit, vel aliò
  terrarum ire disponit, non aliter proficiscatur nisi Metropolitani
  Episcopi Formatas acceperit, quibus sacerdotium suum vel locum
  ecclesiasticum quem habet, scriptorum ejus adstipulatione perdoceat: quod
  ex gratia statuimus quia plures episcopi sive presbyteri sive
  ecclesiastici simulantes, quia nullum documentum Formatarum extat per
  quod valeant confutari, in nomen venerationis irrepunt, &amp; indebitam
  reverentiam promerentur. Quisquis igitur, fratres charissimi, prætermissà
  supradicti Formatâ sive episcopus, sive presbyter, sive diaconus, aut
  deinceps inferiori gradu sit, ad nos venerit: sciat se omnino suscipi non
  posse. Quam auctoritatem ubique nos misisse manifestum est, ut cunctis
  regionibus innotescat id quod statuimus omnimodis esse servandum. Siquis
  autem hæc salubriter constituta temerare tentaverit sponte suâ, se a
  nostra noverit communione discretum. Hoc autem privilegium Formatarum
  sancto Patroclo fratri &amp; coepiscopo nostro, meritorum ejus speciali
  contemplatione, concessimus</i>. And that the Bishop of <i>Arles</i> was
  sometimes the Pope's Vicar over all <i>France</i>, is affirmed also by
  all the Bishops of the Diocess of <i>Arles</i> in their Letter to Pope
  <i>Leo</i> I. <i>Cui id etiam honoris dignitatisque collatum est</i>, say
  they, <i>ut non tantum has Provincias potestate propriâ gubernaret; verum
  etiam omnes Gallias sibi Apostolicæ Sedis vice mandatas, sub omni
  ecclesiastica regula contineret</i>. And Pope <i>Pelagius</i> I. A.C.
  556, in his Epistle to <i>Sapaudus</i> Bishop of <i>Arles</i>: <i>Majorum
  nostrorum, operante Dei misericordiâ, cupientes inhærere vestigiis &amp;
  eorum actus divino examine in omnibus imitari: Charitati tuæ per
  universam Galliam, sanctæ Sedis Apostolicæ, cui divinâ gratiâ præsidemus,
  vices injungimus</i>.</p>

  <p>By the influence of the same imperial Edict, not only <i>Spain</i> and
  <i>Gallia</i>, but also <i>Illyricum</i> became subject to the Pope.
  <i>Damasus</i> made <i>Ascholius</i>, or <i>Acholius</i>, Bishop of
  <i>Thessalonica</i> the Metropolis of <i>Oriental Illyricum</i>, his
  Vicar for hearing of causes; and in the year 382, <i>Acholius</i> being
  summoned by Pope <i>Damasus</i>, came to a Council at <i>Rome</i>. Pope
  <i>Siricius</i> the successor of <i>Damasus</i>, decreed that no Bishop
  should be ordained in <i>Illyricum</i> without the consent of
  <i>Anysius</i> the successor of <i>Acholius</i>. And the following Popes
  gave <i>Rufus</i> the successor of <i>Anysius</i>, a power of calling
  Provincial Councils: for in the Collections of <i>Holstenius</i> there is
  an account of a Council of <i>Rome</i> convened under Pope
  <i>Boniface</i> II. in which were produced Letters of <i>Damasus</i>,
  <i>Syricius</i>, <i>Innocent</i> I. <i>Boniface</i> I. and
  <i>Cælestine</i> Bishops of <i>Rome</i>, to <i>Ascholius</i>,
  <i>Anysius</i> and <i>Rufus</i>, Bishops of <i>Thessalonica</i>: in which
  Letters they commend to them the hearing of causes in <i>Illyricum</i>,
  granted by the Lord and the holy Canons to the Apostolic See thro'out
  that Province. And Pope <i>Siricius</i> saith in his Epistle to
  <i>Anysius</i>: <i>Etiam dudum, frater charissime, per Candidianum
  Episcopum, qui nos præcessit ad Dominum, hujusmodi literas dederamus, ut
  nulla licentia esset, sine consensu tuo in Illyrico Episcopos ordinare
  præsumere, quæ utrum ad te pervenerint scire non potui. Multa enim gesta
  sunt per contentionem ab Episcopis in ordinationibus faciendis, quod tua
  melius caritas novit</i>. And a little after: <i>Ad omnem enim hujusmodi
  audaciam comprimendam vigilare debet instantia tua, Spiritu in te Sancto
  fervente: ut vel ipse, si potes, vel quos judicaveris Episcopos idoneos,
  cum literis dirigas, dato consensu qui possit, in ejus locum qui
  defunctus vel depositus fuerit, Catholicum Episcopum vitâ &amp; moribus
  probatum, secundum Nicænæ Synodi statuta vel Ecclesiæ Romanæ, Clericum de
  Clero meritum ordinare</i>. And Pope <i>Innocent</i> I. saith in his
  Epistle to <i>Anysius</i>: <i>Cui</i> [Anysio] <i>etiam anteriores tanti
  ac tales viri prædecessores mei Episcopi, id est, sanctæ memoriæ Damasus,
  Siricius, atque supra memoratus vir ita detulerunt; ut omnia quæ in
  omnibus illis partibus gererentur, Sanctitati tuæ, quæ plena justitiæ
  est, traderent cognoscenda</i>. And in his Epistle to <i>Rufus</i> the
  successor of <i>Anysius</i>: <i>Ita longis intervallis disterminatis à me
  ecclesiis discat consulendum; ut prudentiæ gravitatique tuæ committendam
  curam causasque, siquæ exoriantur, per Achaiæ, Thessaliæ, Epiri veteris,
  Epiri novæ, &amp; Cretæ, Daciæ mediterraneæ, Daciæ ripensis, M&#339;siæ,
  Dardaniæ, &amp; Prævali ecclesias, Christo Domino annuente, censeam. Verè
  enim ejus sacratissimis monitis lectissimæ sinceritatis tuæ providentiæ
  &amp; virtuti hanc injungimus sollicitudinem: non primitùs hæc
  statuentes, sed Præcessores nostros Apostolicos imitati, qui beatissimis
  Acholio &amp; Anysio injungi pro meritis ista voluerunt</i>. And
  <i>Boniface</i> I. in his decretal Epistle to <i>Rufus</i> and the rest
  of the Bishops in <i>Illyricum</i>: <i>Nullus, ut frequenter dixi,
  alicujus ordinationem citra ejus</i> [Episcopi Thessalonicensis]
  <i>conscientiam celebrare præsumat: cui, ut supra dictum est, vice nostrâ
  cuncta committimus</i>. And Pope <i>Cælestine</i>, in his decretal
  Epistle to the Bishops thro'out <i>Illyricum</i>, saith: <i>Vicem nostram
  per vestram Provinciam noveritis</i> [Rufo] <i>esse commissam, ita ut ad
  eum, fratres carissimi, quicquid de causis agitur, referatur. Sine ejus
  consilio nullus ordinetur. Nullus usurpet, eodem inconscio, commissam
  illi Provinciam; colligere nisi cum ejus voluntate Episcopus non
  præsumat</i>. And in the cause of <i>Perigenes</i>, in the title of his
  Epistle, he thus enumerates the Provinces under this Bishop: <i>Rufo
  &amp; cæteris Episcopis per Macedoniam, Achaiam, Thessaliam, Epirum
  veterem, Epirum novam, Prævalin, &amp; Daciam constitutis</i>. And Pope
  <i>Xistus</i> in a decretal Epistle to the same Bishops: <i>Illyricanæ
  omnes Ecclesiæ, ut à decessoribus nostris recepimus, &amp; nos quoque
  fecimus, ad curam nunc pertinent Thessalonicensis Antistitis, ut suâ
  sollicitudine, siquæ inter fratres nascantur, ut assolent, actiones
  distinguat atque definiat; &amp; ad eum, quicquid à singulis sacerdotibus
  agitur, referatur. Sit Concilium, quotiens causæ fuerint, quotiens ille
  pro necessitatum emergentium ratione decreverit</i>. And Pope <i>Leo</i>
  I. in his decretal Epistle to <i>Anastasius</i> Bishop of
  <i>Thessalonica</i>: <i>Singulis autem Metropolitanis sicut potestas ista
  committitur, ut in suis Provinciis jus habeant ordinandi; ita eos
  Metropolitanos à te volumus ordinari; maturo tamen &amp; decocto
  judicio</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Occidental Illyricum</i> comprehended <i>Pannonia prima</i> and
  <i>secunda</i>, <i>Savia</i>, <i>Dalmatia</i>, <i>Noricum
  mediterraneum</i>, and <i>Noricum ripense</i>; and its Metropolis was
  <i>Sirmium</i>, till <i>Attila</i> destroyed this city. Afterwards
  <i>Laureacum</i> became the Metropolis of <i>Noricum</i> and both
  <i>Pannonias</i>, and <i>Salona</i> the Metropolis of <i>Dalmatia</i>.
  Now <a name="NtpDanVIII_5" href="#NtDanVIII_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> the
  Bishops of <i>Laureacum</i> and <i>Salona</i> received the <i>Pallium</i>
  from the Pope: and <i>Zosimus</i>, in his decretal Epistle to
  <i>Hesychius</i> Bishop of <i>Salona</i>, directed him to denounce the
  Apostolic decrees as well to the Bishops of his own, as to those of the
  neighbouring Provinces. The subjection of these Provinces to the See of
  <i>Rome</i> seems to have begun in <i>Anemius</i>, who was ordained
  Bishop of <i>Sirmium</i> by <i>Ambrose</i> Bishop of <i>Millain</i>, and
  who in the Council of <i>Aquileia</i> under Pope <i>Damasus</i>, A.C.
  381, declared his sentence in these words: <i>Caput Illyrici non nisi
  civitas Sirmiensis: Ego igitur illius civitatis Episcopus sum. Eum qui
  non confitetur filium Dei æternum, &amp; coeternum patri, qui est
  sempiternus, anathema dico</i>. The next year <i>Anemius</i> and
  <i>Ambrose</i>, with <i>Valerian</i> Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i>,
  <i>Acholias</i> Bishop of <i>Thessalonica,</i> and many others, went to
  the Council of <i>Rome</i>, which met for overruling the <i>Greek</i>
  Church by majority of votes, and exalting the authority of the Apostolic
  See, as was attempted before in the Council of <i>Sardica</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Aquileia</i> was the second city of the <i>Western Empire</i>, and
  by some called the second <i>Rome</i>. It was the Metropolis of
  <i>Istria</i>, <i>Forum Julium</i>, and <i>Venetia</i>; and its
  subjection to the See of <i>Rome</i> is manifest by the decretal Epistle
  of <i>Leo</i> I. directed to <i>Nicetas</i> Bishop of this city; for the
  Pope begins his Epistle thus: <i>Regressus ad nos filius meus Adeodatus
  Diaconus Sedis nostræ, dilectionem tuam poposcisse memorat, ut de his à
  nobis authoritatem Apostolicæ Sedis acciperes, quæ quidem magnam
  difficultatem dijudicationis videntur afferre</i>. Then he sets down an
  answer to the questions proposed by <i>Nicetas</i>, and concludes thus:
  <i>Hanc autem Epistolam nostram, quam ad consultationem tuæ fraternitatis
  emisimus, ad omnes fratres &amp; comprovinciales tuos Episcopos facies
  pervenire, ut in omnium observantia, data profit authoritas. Data 1-2
  Kal. Apr. Majorano Aug. Cos.</i> A.C. 458. <i>Gregory</i> the great A.C.
  591, <a name="NtpDanVIII_6" href="#NtDanVIII_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> cited
  <i>Severus</i> Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i> to appear before him in judgment
  in a Council at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

  <p>The Bishops of <i>Aquileia</i> and <i>Millain</i> created one another,
  and therefore were of equal authority, and alike subject to the See of
  <i>Rome</i>. Pope <i>Pelagius</i> about the year 557, testified this in
  the following words: <a name="NtpDanVIII_7"
  href="#NtDanVIII_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> <i>Mos antiquus fuit</i>, saith
  he, <i>ut quia pro longinquitate vel difficultate itineris, ab Apostolico
  illis onerosum fuerit ordinari, ipsi se invicem Mediolanensis &amp;
  Aquileiensis ordinare Episcopos debuissent</i>. These words imply that
  the ordination of these two Bishops belonged to the See of <i>Rome</i>.
  When <i>Laurentius</i> Bishop of <i>Millain</i> had excommunicated
  <i>Magnus</i>, one of his Presbyters, and was dead, <a
  name="NtpDanVIII_8" href="#NtDanVIII_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> <i>Gregory</i>
  the great absolved <i>Magnus</i>, and sent the <i>Pallium</i> to the new
  elected Bishop <i>Constantius</i>; whom the next year <a
  name="NtpDanVIII_9" href="#NtDanVIII_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> he reprehended
  of partiality in judging <i>Fortunatus</i>, and commanded him to send
  <i>Fortunatus</i> to <i>Rome</i> to be judged there: four years after <a
  name="NtpDanVIII_10" href="#NtDanVIII_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> he
  appointed the Bishops of <i>Millain</i> and <i>Ravenna</i> to hear the
  cause of one <i>Maximus</i>; and two years after, <i>viz.</i> A.C. 601,
  when <i>Constantius</i> was dead, and the people of <i>Millain</i> had
  elected <i>Deusdedit</i> his successor, and the <i>Lombards</i> had
  elected another, <a name="NtpDanVIII_11"
  href="#NtDanVIII_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> <i>Gregory</i> wrote to the
  Notary, Clergy, and People of <i>Millain</i>, that by the authority of
  his Letters <i>Deusdedit</i> should be ordained, and that he whom the
  <i>Lombards</i> had ordained was an unworthy successor of <i>Ambrose</i>:
  whence I gather, that the Church of <i>Millain</i> had continued in this
  state of subordination to the See of <i>Rome</i> ever since the days of
  <i>Ambrose</i>; for <i>Ambrose</i> himself acknowledged the authority of
  that See. <i>Ecclesia Romana</i>, <a name="NtpDanVIII_12"
  href="#NtDanVIII_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> saith he, <i>hanc consuetudinem
  non habet, cujus typum in omnibus sequimur, &amp; formam</i>. And a
  little after: <i>In omnibus cupio sequi Ecclesiam Romanam</i>. And in his
  Commentary upon 1 <i>Tim</i>. iii. <i>Cum totus mundus Dei sit, tamen
  domus ejus Ecclesia dicitur, cujus hodie rector est Damasus</i>. In his
  Oration on the death of his brother <i>Satyrus</i>, he relates how his
  brother coming to a certain city of <i>Sardinia</i>, <i>advocavit
  Episcopum loci, percontatusque est ex eo utrum cum Episcopis Catholicis
  hoc est cum Romana Ecclesia conveniret?</i> And in conjunction with the
  Synod of <i>Aquileia</i> A.C. 381, in a synodical Epistle to the Emperor
  <i>Gratian</i>, he saith: <i>Totius orbis Romani caput Romanam Ecclesiam,
  atque illam sacrosanctam Apostolorum fidem, ne turbari sineret,
  obsecranda fuit clementia vestra; inde enim in omnes venerandæ
  communionis jura dimanant</i>. The Churches therefore of <i>Aquileia</i>
  and <i>Millain</i> were subject to the See of <i>Rome</i> from the days
  of the Emperor <i>Gratian</i>. <i>Auxentius</i> the predecessor of
  <i>Ambrose</i> was not subject to the see of <i>Rome</i>, and
  consequently the subjection of the Church of <i>Millain</i> began in
  <i>Ambrose</i>. This Diocese of <i>Millain</i> contained <i>Liguria</i>
  with <i>Insubria</i>, the <i>Alpes Cottiæ</i> and <i>Rhætia</i>; and was
  divided from the Diocese of <i>Aquileia</i> by the river <i>Addua</i>. In
  the year 844, the Bishop of <i>Millain</i> broke off from the See of
  <i>Rome</i>, and continued in this separation about 200 years, as is thus
  related by <a name="NtpDanVIII_13"
  href="#NtDanVIII_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> <i>Sigonius</i>: <i>Eodem anno
  Angilbertus Mediolanensis Archiepiscopus ab Ecclesia Romana parum
  comperta de causa descivit, tantumque exemplo in posterum valuit, ut non
  nisi post ducentos annos Ecclesia Mediolanensis ad Romanæ obedientiam
  auctoritatemque redierit</i>.</p>

  <p>The Bishop of <i>Ravenna</i>, the Metropolis of <i>Flaminia</i> and
  <i>Æmilia</i>, was also subject to the Pope: for <i>Zosimus</i>, A.C.
  417, excommunicated some of the Presbyters of that Church, and wrote a
  commonitory Epistle about them to the Clergy of that Church as a branch
  of the <i>Roman</i> Church: <i>In sua</i>, saith he, <i>hoc est, in
  Ecclesia nostra Romana</i>. When those of <i>Ravenna</i>, having elected
  a new Bishop, gave notice thereof to Pope <i>Sixtus</i>, the Pope set him
  aside, and <a name="NtpDanVIII_14"
  href="#NtDanVIII_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> ordained <i>Peter
  Chrysologus</i> in his room. <i>Chrysologus</i> in his Epistle to
  <i>Eutyches</i>, extant in the Acts of the Council of <i>Chalcedon</i>,
  wrote thus: <i>Nos pro studio pacis &amp; fidei, extra consensum Romanæ
  civitatis Episcopi, causas fidei audire non possumus</i>. Pope <i>Leo</i>
  I. being consulted by <i>Leo</i> Bishop of <i>Ravenna</i> about some
  questions, answered him by a decretal Epistle A.C. 451. And Pope
  <i>Gregory</i> the great, <a name="NtpDanVIII_15"
  href="#NtDanVIII_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> reprehending <i>John</i> Bishop
  of <i>Ravenna</i> about the use of the <i>Pallium</i>, tells him of a
  Precept of one of his Predecessors, Pope <i>John</i>, commanding that all
  the Privileges formerly granted to the Bishop and Church of
  <i>Ravenna</i> should be kept: to this <i>John</i> returned a submissive
  answer; and after his death Pope <i>Gregory</i> ordered a visitation of
  the Church of <i>Ravenna</i>, confirmed the privileges heretofore granted
  them, and sent his <i>Pallium</i>, as of antient custom, to their new
  Bishop <i>Marinian</i>. Yet this Church revolted sometimes from the
  Church of <i>Rome</i>, but returned again to its obedience.</p>

  <p>The rest of <i>Italy</i>, with the Islands adjacent, containing the
  <i>suburbicarian</i> regions, or ten Provinces under the temporal Vicar
  of <i>Rome, viz.</i> <sup>1</sup><i>Campania</i>,
  <sup>2</sup><i>Tuscia</i> and <i>Umbria</i>, <sup>3</sup><i>Picenum
  suburbicarium</i>, <sup>4</sup><i>Sicily</i>, <sup>5</sup><i>Apulia</i>
  and <i>Calabria</i>, <sup>6</sup><i>Brutii</i> and <i>Lucania</i>,
  <sup>7</sup><i>Samnium</i>, <sup>8</sup><i>Sardinia</i>,
  <sup>9</sup><i>Corsica</i>, and <sup>10</sup><i>Valeria</i>, constituted
  the proper Province of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>. For the Council of
  <i>Nice</i> in their fifth Canon ordained that Councils should be held
  every spring and autumn in every Province; and according to this Canon,
  the Bishops of this Province met at <i>Rome</i> every half year. In this
  sense Pope <i>Leo</i> I. applied this Canon to <i>Rome</i>, in a decretal
  Epistle to the Bishops of <i>Sicily</i>, written <i>Alippio &amp;
  Ardabure Coss</i>. A.C. 447. <i>Quia saluberrime</i>, saith he, <i>à
  sanctis patribus constitutum est, binos in annis singulis Episcoporum
  debere esse conventus, terni semper ex vobis ad diem tertium Kalendarum
  Octobrium Romam æterno concilio sociandi occurrant. Et indissimulanter à
  vobis hæc consuetudo servetur, quoniam adjuvante Dei gratiâ, faciliùs
  poterit provideri, ut in Ecclesiis Christi nulla scandala, nulli
  nascantur errores; cum coram Apostolo Petro semper in communione
  tractatum fuerit, ut omnia Canonum Decreta apud omnes Domini sacerdotes
  inviolata permaneant</i>. The Province of <i>Rome</i> therefore
  comprehended <i>Sicily</i>, with so much of <i>Italy</i> and the
  neighbouring Islands as sent Bishops to the annual Councils of
  <i>Rome</i>; but extended not into the Provinces of <i>Ravenna</i>,
  <i>Aquileia</i>, <i>Millain</i>, <i>Arles</i>, &amp;c. those Provinces
  having Councils of their own. The Bishops in every Province of the
  <i>Roman</i> Empire were convened in Council by the Metropolitan or
  Bishop of the head city of the Province, and this Bishop presided in that
  Council: but the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> did not only preside in his own
  Council of the Bishops of the <i>suburbicarian</i> regions, but also gave
  Orders to the Metropolitans of all the other Provinces in the <i>Western
  Empire</i>, as their universal governor; as may be further perceived by
  the following instances.</p>

  <p>Pope <i>Zosimus</i> A.C. 417, cited <i>Proculus</i> Bishop of
  <i>Marseilles</i> to appear before a Council at <i>Rome</i> for
  illegitimate Ordinations; and condemned him, as he mentions in several of
  his Epistles. Pope <i>Boniface</i> I. A.C. 419, upon a complaint of the
  Clergy of <i>Valentia</i> against <i>Maximus</i> a Bishop, summoned the
  Bishops of all <i>Gallia</i> and the seven Provinces to convene in a
  Council against him; and saith in his Epistle, that his Predecessors had
  done the like. Pope <i>Leo</i> I. called a general Council of all the
  Provinces of <i>Spain</i> to meet in <i>Gallæcia</i> against the
  <i>Manichees</i> and <i>Priscillianists</i>, as he says in his decretal
  Epistle to <i>Turribius</i> a <i>Spanish</i> Bishop. And in one of his
  decretal Epistles to <i>Nicetas</i> Bishop of <i>Aquileia</i>, he
  commands him to call a Council of the Bishops of that Province against
  the <i>Pelagians</i>, which might ratify all the Synodal Decrees which
  had been already ratified by the See of <i>Rome</i> against this heresy.
  And in his decretal Epistle to <i>Anastasius</i> Bishop of
  <i>Thessalonica</i>, he ordained that Bishop should hold two Provincial
  Councils every year, and refer the harder causes to the See of
  <i>Rome</i>: and if upon any extraordinary occasion it should be
  necessary to call a Council, he should not be troublesom to the Bishops
  under him, but content himself with two Bishops out of every Province,
  and not detain them above fifteen days. In the same Epistle he describes
  the form of Church-Government then set up, to consist in a subordination
  of all the Churches to the See of <i>Rome</i>: <i>De qua forma</i>, saith
  he, <i>Episcoporum quoque est orta distinctio, &amp; magna dispositione
  provisum est ne omnes sibi omnia vindicarent, sed essent in singulis
  Provinciis singuli quorum inter fratres haberetur prima sententia, &amp;
  rursus quidam in majoribus urbibus constituti sollicitudinem sumerent
  ampliorem, per quos ad unam Petri Sedem universalis Ecclesiæ cura
  conflueret, &amp; nihil usque à suo capite dissideret. Qui ergo scit se
  quibusdam esse præpositum, non moleste ferat aliquem sibi esse
  præpositum; sed obedientiam quam exigit etiam ipse dependat; et sicut non
  vult gravis oneris sarcinam ferre, ita non audeat aliis importabile
  pondus imponere</i>. These words sufficiently shew the monarchical form
  of government then set up in the Churches of the <i>Western Empire</i>
  under the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, by means of the imperial Decree of
  <i>Gratian</i>, and the appeals and decretal Epistles grounded
  thereupon.</p>

  <p>The same Pope <i>Leo</i>, having in a Council at <i>Rome</i> passed
  sentence upon <i>Hilary</i> Bishop of <i>Arles</i>, for what he had done
  by a Provincial Council in <i>Gallia</i>, took occasion from thence to
  procure the following Edict from the <i>Western</i> Emperor
  <i>Valentinian</i> III. for the more absolute establishing the authority
  of his See over all the Churches of the <i>Western Empire</i>.</p>

  servet per multos annos, parens carissime. Dat. </i>viii.<i> Id. Jun.
  Romæ, Valentiniano A. </i>vi.<i> Consule</i>, A.C. 445. By this Edict the
  Emperor <i>Valentinian</i> enjoined an absolute obedience to the will of
  the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> thro'out all the Churches of his Empire; and
  declares, that for the Bishops to attempt any thing without the Pope's
  authority is contrary to antient custom, and that the Bishops summoned to
  appear before his judicature must be carried thither by the Governor of
  the Province; and he ascribes these privileges of the See of <i>Rome</i>
  to the concessions of his dead Ancestors, that is, to the Edict of
  <i>Gratian</i> and <i>Valentinian</i> II. as above: by which reckoning
  this dominion of the Church of <i>Rome</i> was now of 66 years standing:
  and if in all this time it had not been sufficiently established, this
  new Edict was enough to settle it beyond all question thro'out the
  <i>Western Empire</i>.</p>

  <p>Hence all the Bishops of the Province of <i>Arles</i> in their Letter
  to Pope <i>Leo</i>, A.C. 450, petitioning for a restitution of the
  privileges of their Metropolitan, say: <i>Per beatum Petrum Apostolorum
  principem, sacrosancta Ecclesia Romana tenebat supra omnes totius mundi
  Ecclesias principatum</i>. And <i>Ceratius</i>, <i>Salonius</i> and
  <i>Veranus</i>, three Bishops of <i>Gallia</i>, say, in their Epistle to
  the same Pope: <i>Magna præterea &amp; ineffabili quadam nos peculiares
  tui gratulatione succrescimus, quod illa specialis doctrinæ vestræ pagina
  ita per omnium Ecclesiarum conventicula celebratur, ut vere consona
  omnium sententia declaretur; merito illic principatum Sedis Apostolicæ
  constitutum, unde adhuc Apostolici spiritus oracula reserentur</i>. And
  <i>Leo</i> himself, in <a name="NtpDanVIII_16"
  href="#NtDanVIII_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> his Epistle to the metropolitan
  Bishops thro'out <i>Illyricum</i>: <i>Quia per omnes Ecclesias cura
  nostra distenditur, exigente hoc à nobis Domino, qui Apostolicæ
  dignitatis beatissimo Apostolo Petro primatum, fidei sui remuneratione
  commisit, universalem Ecclesiam in fundamenti ipsius soliditate
  constituens</i>.</p>

  <p>While this Ecclesiastical Dominion was rising up, the northern
  barbarous nations invaded the <i>Western Empire</i>, and founded several
  kingdoms therein, of different religions from the Church of <i>Rome</i>.
  But these kingdoms by degrees embraced the <i>Roman</i> faith, and at the
  same time submitted to the Pope's authority. The <i>Franks</i> in
  <i>Gaul</i> submitted in the end of the fifth Century, the <i>Goths</i>
  in <i>Spain</i> in the end of the sixth; and the <i>Lombards</i> in
  <i>Italy</i> were conquered by <i>Charles</i> the great A.C. 774. Between
  the years 775 and 794, the same <i>Charles</i> extended the Pope's
  authority over all <i>Germany</i> and <i>Hungary</i> as far as the river
  <i>Theysse</i> and the <i>Baltic</i> sea; he then set him above all human
  judicature, and at the same time assisted him in subduing the City and
  Duchy of <i>Rome</i>. By the conversion of the ten kingdoms to the
  <i>Roman</i> religion, the Pope only enlarged his spiritual dominion, but
  did not yet rise up as a horn of the Beast. It was his temporal dominion
  which made him one of the horns: and this dominion he acquired in the
  latter half of the eighth century, by subduing three of the former horns
  as above. And now being arrived at a temporal dominion, and a power above
  all human judicature, he reigned <a name="NtpDanVIII_17"
  href="#NtDanVIII_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> <i>with a look more stout than
  his fellows</i>, and <a name="NtpDanVIII_18"
  href="#NtDanVIII_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> <i>times and laws were</i>
  henceforward <i>given into his hands, for a time times and half a
  time</i>, or three times and an half; that is, for 1260 solar years,
  reckoning a time for a Calendar year of 360 days, and a day for a solar
  year. After which <a name="NtpDanVIII_19"
  href="#NtDanVIII_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> <i>the judgment is to sit, and
  they shall take away his dominion</i>, not at once, but by degrees, <i>to
  consume, and to destroy it unto the end. <a name="NtpDanVIII_20"

  and greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall</i>, by
  degrees, <i>be given unto the people of the saints of the most High,

  and obey him</i>.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the kingdoms represented in </i>Daniel<i>
by the Ram and He-Goat</i>.</p>

  <p>The second and third Empires, represented by the Bear and Leopard, are
  again represented by the Ram and He-Goat; but with this difference, that
  the Ram represents the kingdoms of the <i>Medes</i> and <i>Persians</i>
  from the beginning of the four Empires, and the Goat represents the
  kingdom of the <i>Greeks</i> to the end of them. By this means, under the
  type of the Ram and He-Goat, the times of all the four Empires are again
  described: <i>I lifted up mine eyes</i>, saith <a name="NtpDanIX_1"
  href="#NtDanIX_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <i>Daniel</i>, <i>and saw</i>,
  <i>and behold there stood before the river</i> [Ulai] <i>a Ram which had
  two horns, and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the
  other, and the higher came up last.&mdash;And the Ram having two horns,
  are the kings of </i>Media<i> and </i>Persia: not two persons but two
  kingdoms, the kingdoms of <i>Media</i> and <i>Persia</i>; and the kingdom
  of <i>Persia</i> was the higher horn and came up last. The kingdom of
  <i>Persia</i> rose up, when <i>Cyrus</i> having newly conquered
  <i>Babylon</i>, revolted from <i>Darius</i> King of the <i>Medes</i>, and
  beat him at <i>Pasargadæ</i>, and set up the <i>Persians</i> above the
  <i>Medes</i>. This was the horn which came up last. And the horn which
  came up first was the kingdom of the <i>Medes</i>, from the time that
  <i>Cyaxares</i> and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> overthrew <i>Nineveh</i>, and
  shared the Empire of the <i>Assyrians</i> between them. The Empires of
  <i>Media</i> and <i>Babylon</i> were contemporary, and rose up together
  by the fall of the <i>Assyrian</i> Empire; and the Prophecy of the four
  Beasts begins with one of them, and that of the Ram and He-Goat with the
  other. As the Ram represents the kingdom of <i>Media</i> and
  <i>Persia</i> from the beginning of the four Empires; so the He-Goat
  represents the Empire of the <i>Greeks</i> to the end of those
  Monarchies. In the reign of his great horn, and of the four horns which
  succeeded it, he represents this Empire during the reign of the Leopard:
  and in the reign of his little horn, which stood up in the latter time of
  the kingdom of the four, and after their fall became mighty but not by
  his own power, he represents it during the reign of the fourth Beast.</p>

  <p><i>The rough Goat</i>, saith <i>Daniel, is the King of</i> Grecia,
  that is, the kingdom; <i>and the great horn between his eyes is the first
  King</i>: not the first Monarch, but the first kingdom, that which lasted
  during the reign of <i>Alexander</i> the great, and his brother
  <i>Aridæus</i> and two young sons, <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Hercules</i>.
  <a name="NtpDanIX_2" href="#NtDanIX_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>Now that</i>
  [horn] <i>being broken off, whereas four</i> [horns] <i>stood up for it,
  four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation</i> [of the
  <i>Greeks</i>], <i>but not in his</i> [the first horn's] <i>power</i>.
  The four horns are therefore four kingdoms; and by consequence, the first
  great horn which they succeeded is the first great kingdom of the
  <i>Greeks</i>, that which was founded by <i>Alexander</i> the great,
  <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 414, and lasted till the death of his son
  <i>Hercules</i>, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 441. And the four are those of
  <i>Cassander</i>, <i>Lysimachus</i>, <i>Antigonus</i>, and
  <i>Ptolemy</i>, as above.</p>

  <p><a name="NtpDanIX_3" href="#NtDanIX_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <i>And in
  the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the
  full, a King</i> [or new kingdom] <i>of fierce countenance, and
  understanding dark sentences, shall stand up: and his power shall be
  mighty, but not by his own power</i>. This King was the last horn of the
  Goat, the little horn which came up out of one of the four horns, and
  waxed exceeding great. The latter time of their kingdom was when the
  <i>Romans</i> began to conquer them, that is, when they conquered
  <i>Perseus</i> King of <i>Macedonia</i>, the fundamental kingdom of the
  <i>Greeks</i>. And at that time the transgressors came to the full: for
  then the High-priesthood was exposed to sale, the Vessels of the Temple
  were sold to pay for the purchase; and the High-priest, with some of the
  <i>Jews</i>, procured a licence from <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i> to do
  after the ordinances of the heathen, and set up a school at
  <i>Jerusalem</i> for teaching those ordinances. Then <i>Antiochus</i>
  took <i>Jerusalem</i> with an armed force, slew 4000 <i>Jews</i>, took as
  many prisoners and sold them, spoiled the Temple, interdicted the
  worship, commanded the Law of <i>Moses</i> to be burnt, and set up the
  worship of the heathen Gods in all <i>Judea</i>. In the very same year,
  <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 580, the <i>Romans</i> conquered <i>Macedonia</i>,
  the chief of the four horns. Hitherto the Goat was mighty by its own
  power, but henceforward began to be under the <i>Romans</i>.
  <i>Daniel</i> distinguishes the times, by describing very particularly
  the actions of the Kings of the north and south, those two of the four
  horns which bordered upon <i>Judea</i>, until the <i>Romans</i> conquered
  <i>Macedonia</i>; and thenceforward only touching upon the main
  revolutions which happened within the compass of the nations represented
  by the Goat. In this latter period of time the little horn was to stand
  up and grow mighty, but not by his own power.</p>

  <p>The three first of <i>Daniel</i>'s Beasts had their dominions taken
  away, each of them at the rise of the next Beast; but their lives were
  prolonged, and they are all of them still alive. The third Beast, or
  Leopard, reigned in his four heads, till the rise of the fourth Beast, or
  Empire of the <i>Latins</i>; and his life was prolonged under their
  power. This Leopard reigning in his four heads, signifies the same thing
  with the He-Goat reigning in his four horns: and therefore the He-Goat
  reigned in his four horns till the rise of <i>Daniel</i>'s fourth Beast,
  or Empire of the <i>Latins</i>: then its dominion was taken away by the
  <i>Latins</i>, but its life was prolonged under their power. The
  <i>Latins</i> are not comprehended among the nations represented by the
  He-Goat in this Prophecy: their power over the <i>Greeks</i> is only
  named in it, to distinguish the times in which the He-Goat was mighty by
  his own power, from the times in which he was mighty but not by his own
  power. He was mighty by his own power till his dominion was taken away by
  the <i>Latins</i>; after that, his life was prolonged under their
  dominion, and this prolonging of his life was in the days of his last
  horn: for in the days of this horn the Goat became mighty, but not by his
  own power.</p>

  <p>Now because this horn was a horn of the Goat, we are to look for it
  among the nations which composed the body of the Goat. Among those
  nations he was to rise up and grow mighty: he grew mighty <a
  name="NtpDanIX_4" href="#NtDanIX_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <i>towards the
  south, and towards the east, and towards the pleasant land</i>; and
  therefore he was to rise up in the north-west parts of those nations, and
  extend his dominion towards <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Syria</i> and <i>Judea</i>.
  In the latter time of the kingdom of the four horns, it was to rise up
  out of one of them and subdue the rest, but not by its own power. It was
  to be assisted by a foreign power, a power superior to itself, the power
  which took away the dominion of the third Beast, the power of the fourth
  Beast. And such a little horn was the kingdom of <i>Macedonia</i>, from
  the time that it became subject to the <i>Romans</i>. This kingdom, by
  the victory of the <i>Romans</i> over <i>Persius</i> King of
  <i>Macedonia</i>, <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 580, ceased to be one of the four
  horns of the Goat, and became a dominion of a new sort: not a horn of the
  fourth Beast, for <i>Macedonia</i> belonged to the body of the third; but
  a horn of the third Beast of a new sort, a horn of the Goat which grew
  mighty but not by his own power, a horn which rose up and grew potent
  under a foreign power, the power of the <i>Romans</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Romans</i>, by the legacy of <i>Attalus</i> the last King of
  <i>Pergamus</i>, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 615, inherited that kingdom,
  including all <i>Asia Minor</i> on this side mount <i>Taurus</i>. <i>An.
  Nabonass.</i> 684 and 685 they conquered <i>Armenia</i>, <i>Syria</i> and
  <i>Judea</i>; <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 718, they subdued <i>Egypt</i>. And by
  these conquests the little horn <a name="NtpDanIX_5"
  href="#NtDanIX_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> <i>waxed exceeding great towards the
  south, and towards the east, and towards the pleasant land. And it waxed
  great even to the host of heaven; and cast down some of the host and of
  the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them</i>, that is, upon the
  people and great men of the <i>Jews</i>. <a name="NtpDanIX_6"
  href="#NtDanIX_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> <i>Yea, he magnified himself even to
  the Prince of the Host</i>, the <i>Messiah</i>, the Prince of the
  <i>Jews</i>, whom he put to death, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 780. <i>And by
  him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary
  was cast down</i>, <i>viz.</i> in the wars which the armies of the
  <i>Eastern</i> nations under the conduct of the <i>Romans</i> made
  against <i>Judea</i>, when <i>Nero</i> and <i>Vespasian</i> were
  Emperors, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 816, 817, 818. <a name="NtpDanIX_7"
  href="#NtDanIX_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> <i>And an host was given him against
  the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the
  truth to the ground, and it practised and prospered</i>. This
  transgression is in the next words called <i>the transgression of
  desolation</i>; and in <i>Dan.</i> xi. 31. <i>the abomination which
  maketh desolate</i>; and in <i>Matth.</i> xxiv. 15. <i>the abomination of
  desolation, spoken of by </i>Daniel<i> the prophet, standing in the holy
  place</i>. It may relate chiefly to the worship of <i>Jupiter
  Olympius</i> in his Temple built by the Emperor <i>Hadrian</i>, in the
  place of the Temple of the <i>Jews</i>, and to the revolt of the
  <i>Jews</i> under <i>Barchochab</i> occasioned thereby, and to the
  desolation of <i>Judea</i> which followed thereupon; all the <i>Jews</i>,
  being thenceforward banished <i>Judea</i> upon pain of death. <i>Then I
  heard</i>, saith <a name="NtpDanIX_8"
  href="#NtDanIX_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> <i>Daniel, one saint speaking, and
  another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be
  the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of
  desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under
  foot? And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then
  shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</i> <i>Daniel</i>'s days are years; and
  these years may perhaps be reckoned either from the destruction of the
  Temple by the <i>Romans</i> in the reign of <i>Vespasian</i>, or from the
  pollution of the Sanctuary by the worship of <i>Jupiter Olympius</i>, or
  from the desolation of <i>Judea</i> made in the end of the <i>Jewish</i>
  war by the banishment of all the <i>Jews</i> out of their own country, or
  from some other period which time will discover. Henceforward the last
  horn of the Goat continued mighty under the <i>Romans</i>, till the reign
  of <i>Constantine</i> the great and his sons: and then by the division of
  the <i>Roman</i> Empire between the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>
  Emperors, it separated from the <i>Latins</i>, and became the
  <i>Greek</i> Empire alone, but yet under the dominion of a <i>Roman</i>
  family; and at present it is mighty under the dominion of the
  <i>Turks</i>.</p>

  <p>This last horn is by some taken for <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i>, but
  not very judiciously. A horn of a Beast is never taken for a single
  person: it always signifies a new kingdom, and the kingdom of
  <i>Antiochus</i> was an old one. <i>Antiochus</i> reigned over one of the
  four horns, and the little horn was a fifth under its proper kings. This
  horn was at first a little one, and waxed exceeding great, but so did not
  <i>Antiochus</i>. It is described great above all the former horns, and
  so was not <i>Antiochus</i>. His kingdom on the contrary was weak, and
  tributary to the <i>Romans</i>, and he did not enlarge it. The horn was a
  <i>King of fierce countenance, and destroyed wonderfully, and prospered
  and practised</i>; that is, he prospered in his practises against the
  holy people: but <i>Antiochus</i> was frighted out of <i>Egypt</i> by a
  mere message of the <i>Romans</i>, and afterwards routed and baffled by
  the <i>Jews</i>. The horn was mighty by another's power, <i>Antiochus</i>
  acted by his own. The horn stood up against the Prince of the Host of
  heaven, the Prince of Princes; and this is the character not of
  <i>Antiochus</i> but of <i>Antichrist</i>. The horn cast down the
  Sanctuary to the ground, and so did not <i>Antiochus</i>; he left it
  standing. The Sanctuary and Host were trampled under foot 2300 days; and
  in <i>Daniel</i>'s Prophecies days are put for years: but the profanation
  of the Temple in the reign of <i>Antiochus</i> did not last so many
  natural days. These were to last till the time of the end, till the last
  end of the indignation against the <i>Jews</i>; and this indignation is
  not yet at an end. They were to last till the Sanctuary which had been
  cast down should be cleansed, and the Sanctuary is not yet cleansed.</p>

  <p>This Prophecy of the Ram and He-Goat is repeated in the last Prophecy
  of <i>Daniel</i>. There the Angel tells <i>Daniel</i>, that <a
  name="NtpDanIX_9" href="#NtDanIX_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> <i>he stood up to
  strengthen </i>Darius<i> the </i>Mede<i>, and that there should stand up
  yet three kings in </i>Persia, [<i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Cambyses</i>, and
  <i>Darius Hystaspis</i>] <i>and the fourth</i> [<i>Xerxes</i>] <i>should
  be far richer than they all; and by his wealth thro' his riches he should
  stir up all against the realm of </i>Grecia. This relates to the Ram,
  whose two horns were the kingdoms of <i>Media</i> and <i>Persia</i>. Then
  he goes on to describe the horns of the Goat by the <a name="NtpDanIX_10"
  href="#NtDanIX_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> <i>standing up of a mighty king,
  which should rule with great dominion, and do according to his will</i>;
  and by the breaking of his kingdom into four smaller kingdoms, and not
  descending to his own posterity. Then he describes the actions of two of
  those kingdoms which bordered on <i>Judea</i>, <i>viz</i>. <i>Egypt</i>
  and <i>Syria</i>, calling them the Kings of the <i>South</i> and
  <i>North</i>, that is, in respect of <i>Judea</i>; and he carries on the
  description till the latter end of the kingdoms of the four, and till the
  reign of <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i>, when transgressors were come to the
  full. In the eighth year of <i>Antiochus</i>, the year in which he
  profaned the Temple and set up the heathen Gods in all <i>Judea</i>, and
  the <i>Romans</i> conquered the kingdom of <i>Macedon</i>; the prophetic
  Angel leaves off describing the affairs of the kings of the <i>South</i>
  and <i>North</i>, and begins to describe those of the <i>Greeks</i> under
  the dominion of the <i>Romans</i>, in these words: <a name="NtpDanIX_11"
  href="#NtDanIX_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> <i>And after him Arms</i> [the
  <i>Romans</i>] <i>shall stand up, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of
  strength</i>. As <span lang="he" title="MMLK" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5DE;&#x5DC;&#x5DA;</bdo></span> signifies <i>after
  the king</i>, Dan. xi. 8; so here <span lang="he" title="MMNW" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5DE;&#x5E0;&#x5D5;</bdo></span> may signify <i>after
  him</i>: and so <span lang="he" title="MN-H'CHT" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5DF;&#x5BE;&#x5D4;&#x5D0;&#x5D7;&#x5EA;</bdo></span>
  may signify <i>after one of them</i>, Dan. viii. 9. Arms are every where
  in these Prophecies of <i>Daniel</i> put for the military power of a
  kingdom, and they stand up when they conquer and grow powerful. The
  <i>Romans</i> conquered <i>Illyricum</i>, <i>Epirus</i> and
  <i>Macedonia</i>, in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 580; and thirty five
  years after, by the last will and testament of <i>Attalus</i> the last
  King of <i>Pergamus</i>, they inherited that rich and flourishing
  kingdom, that is, all <i>Asia</i> on this side mount <i>Taurus</i>: and
  sixty nine years after, they conquered the kingdom of <i>Syria</i>, and
  reduced it into a Province: and thirty four years after they did the like
  to <i>Egypt</i>. By all these steps the <i>Roman</i> arms stood up over
  the <i>Greeks</i>. And after 95 years more, by making war upon the
  <i>Jews, they polluted the sanctuary of strength, and took away the daily
  sacrifice, and</i>, in its room soon after, <i>placed the abomination
  which made</i> the Land <i>desolate</i>: for this abomination was placed
  after the days of Christ, <i>Matth.</i> xxiv. 15. In the 16th year of the
  Emperor <i>Hadrian</i>, A. C. 132, they placed this abomination by
  building a Temple to <i>Jupiter Capitolinus</i>, where the Temple of God
  in <i>Jerusalem</i> had stood. Thereupon the <i>Jews</i> under the
  conduct of <i>Barchochab</i> rose up in arms against the <i>Romans</i>,
  and in that war had 50 cities demolished, 985 of their best towns
  destroyed, and 580000 men slain by the sword: and in the end of the war,
  A.C. 136, they were all banished <i>Judea</i> upon pain or death; and
  that time the land hath remained desolate of its old inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Now that the prophetic Angel passes in this manner from the four
  kingdoms of the <i>Greeks</i> to the <i>Romans</i> reigning over the
  <i>Greeks</i>, is confirmed from hence, that in the next place he
  describes the affairs of the <i>Christians</i> unto the time of the end,
  in these words: <a name="NtpDanIX_12"
  href="#NtDanIX_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> <i>And they that understand among
  the people shall instruct many, yet they shall fall by the sword and by
  flame, by captivity and by spoil many days. Now when they shall fall they
  shall be holpen with a little help</i>, <i>viz</i>. in the reign of
  <i>Constantine</i> the great; <i>but many shall cleave to them with
  dissimulation. And some of them of understanding there shall fall to try
  them, and to purge</i> them from the dissemblers; <i>and to make them
  white even to the time of the end</i>. And a little after, the time of
  the end is said to be <i>a time, times, and half a time</i>: which is the
  duration of the reign of the last horn of <i>Daniel</i>'s fourth Beast,
  and of the <i>Woman</i> and her <i>Beast</i> in the <i>Apocalyps</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="DanX">CHAP. X</a>.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the Prophecy of the Seventy Weeks.</i></p>

  <p>The Vision of the Image composed of four Metals was given first to
  <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, and then to <i>Daniel</i> in a dream: and
  <i>Daniel</i> began then to be celebrated for revealing of secrets,
  <i>Ezek.</i> xxviii. 3. The Vision of the four Beasts, and of <i>the Son
  of man</i> coming in the clouds of heaven, was also given to
  <i>Daniel</i> in a dream. That of the Ram and the He-Goat appeared to him
  in the day time, when he was by the bank of the river <i>Ulay</i>; and
  was explained to him by the prophetic Angel <i>Gabriel</i>. It concerns
  the <i>Prince of the host</i>, and the <i>Prince of Princes</i>: and now
  in the first year of <i>Darius</i> the <i>Mede</i> over <i>Babylon</i>,
  the same prophetic Angel appears to <i>Daniel</i> again, and explains to
  him what is meant by the <i>Son of man</i>, by the <i>Prince of the
  host</i>, and the <i>Prince of Princes</i>. The Prophecy of the <i>Son of
  man</i> coming in the clouds of heaven relates to the second coming of
  <i>Christ</i>; that of the <i>Prince of the host</i> relates to his first
  coming: and this Prophecy of the <i>Messiah</i>, in explaining them,
  relates to both comings, and assigns the times thereof.</p>

  <p>This Prophecy, like all the rest of <i>Daniel</i>'s, consists of two
  parts, an introductory Prophecy and an explanation thereof; the whole I
  thus translate and interpret.</p>

  <p><a name="NtpDanX_1" href="#NtDanX_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> '<i>Seventy
  weeks are <a name="NtpDanX_2" href="#NtDanX_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> cut out
  upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and <a
  name="NtpDanX_3" href="#NtDanX_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> to make an end of
  sins, to expiate iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, to
  consummate the Vision and <a name="NtpDanX_4"
  href="#NtDanX_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the Prophet, and to anoint the most
  Holy</i>.</p>

  <p>'<i>Know also and understand, that from the going forth of the
  commandment to cause to return and to build </i>Jerusalem<i>, unto <a
  name="NtpDanX_5" href="#NtDanX_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> the Anointed the
  Prince, shall be seven weeks</i>.</p>

  <p>'<i>Yet threescore and two weeks shall <a name="NtpDanX_6"
  href="#NtDanX_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> it return, and the street be built
  and the wall; but in troublesome times: and after the threescore and two
  weeks, the Anointed shall be cut off, and <a
  href="#NtDanX_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> it shall not be his; but the people
  of a Prince to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary: and the end
  thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war, desolations
  are determined</i>.</p>

  <p>'<i>Yet shall he confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in
  half a week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease: and upon
  a wing of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the
  consummation, and that which is determined be poured upon the
  desolate</i>.'</p>

  <p><i>Seventy weeks are cut out upon thy people, and upon thy holy city,
  to finish transgression</i>, &amp;c. Here, by putting a week for seven
  years, are reckoned 490 years from the time that the dispersed
  <i>Jews</i> should be re-incorporated into <a name="NtpDanX_7"
  href="#NtDanX_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> a people and a holy city, until the
  death and resurrection of <i>Christ</i>; whereby <i>transgression should
  be finished, and sins ended, iniquity be expiated, and everlasting
  righteousness brought in, and this Vision be accomplished, and the
  Prophet consummated</i>, that Prophet whom the <i>Jews</i> expected; and
  whereby <i>the most Holy</i> should be <i>anointed</i>, he who is
  therefore in the next words called the <i>Anointed</i>, that is, the
  <i>Messiah</i>, or the <i>Christ</i>. For by joining the accomplishment
  of the vision with the expiation of sins, the 490 years are ended with
  the death of <i>Christ</i>. Now the dispersed <i>Jews</i> became a people
  and city when they first returned into a polity or body politick; and
  this was in the seventh year of <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>, when
  <i>Ezra</i> returned with a body of <i>Jews</i> from captivity, and
  revived the <i>Jewish</i> worship; and by the King's commission created
  Magistrates in all the land, to judge and govern the people according to
  the laws of God and the King, <i>Ezra</i> vii. 25. There were but two
  returns from captivity, <i>Zerubbabel</i>'s and <i>Ezra</i>'s; in
  <i>Zerubbabel</i>'s they had only commission to build the Temple, in
  <i>Ezra</i>'s they first became a polity or city by a government of their
  own. Now the years of this <i>Artaxerxes</i> began about two or three
  months after the summer solstice, and his seventh year fell in with the
  third year of the eightieth <i>Olympiad</i>; and the latter part thereof,
  wherein <i>Ezra</i> went up to <i>Jerusalem</i>, was in the year of the
  <i>Julian Period</i> 4257. Count the time from thence to the death of
  <i>Christ</i>, and you will find it just 490 years. If you count in
  <i>Judaic</i> years commencing in autumn, and date the reckoning from the
  first autumn after <i>Ezra</i>'s coming to <i>Jerusalem</i>, when he put
  the King's decree in execution; the death of <i>Christ</i> will fall on
  the year of the <i>Julian Period</i> 4747, <i>Anno Domini</i> 34; and the
  weeks will be <i>Judaic</i> weeks, ending with sabbatical years; and this
  I take to be the truth: but if you had rather place the death of
  <i>Christ</i> in the year before, as is commonly done, you may take the
  year of <i>Ezra</i>'s journey into the reckoning.</p>

  <p><i>Know also and understand, that from the going forth of the
  commandment to cause to return and to build </i>Jerusalem<i>, unto the
  Anointed the Prince, shall be seven weeks</i>. The former part of the
  Prophecy related to the first coming of <i>Christ</i>, being dated to his
  coming as a Prophet; this being dated to his coming to be Prince or King,
  seems to relate to his second coming. There, the Prophet was consummate,
  and the most holy anointed: here, he that was anointed comes to be Prince
  and to reign. For <i>Daniel</i>'s Prophecies reach to the end of the
  world; and there is scarce a Prophecy in the Old Testament concerning
  <i>Christ</i>, which doth not in something or other relate to his second
  coming. If divers of the antients, as <a name="NtpDanX_8"
  href="#NtDanX_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> <i>Irenæus</i>, <a name="NtpDanX_9"
  href="#NtDanX_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> <i>Julius Africanus</i>,
  <i>Hippolytus</i> the martyr, and <i>Apollinaris</i> Bishop of
  <i>Laodicea</i>, applied the half week to the times of <i>Antichrist</i>;
  why may not we, by the same liberty of interpretation, apply the seven
  weeks to the time when <i>Antichrist</i> shall be destroyed by the
  brightness of <i>Christ</i>'s coming?</p>

  <p>The <i>Israelites</i> in the days of the antient Prophets, when the
  ten Tribes were led into captivity, expected a double return; and that at
  the first the <i>Jews</i> should build a new Temple inferior to
  <i>Solomon</i>'s, until the time of that age should be fulfilled; and
  afterwards they should return from all places of their captivity, and
  build <i>Jerusalem</i> and the Temple gloriously, <i>Tobit</i> xiv. 4, 5,
  6: and to express the glory and excellence of this city, it is
  figuratively said to be built of precious stones, <i>Tobit</i> xiii. 16,
  17, 18. <i>Isa.</i> liv. 11, 12. <i>Rev.</i> xi. and called the <i>New
  Jerusalem</i>, the <i>Heavenly Jerusalem</i>, the <i>Holy City</i>, the
  <i>Lamb's Wife</i>, the <i>City of the Great King</i>, the <i>City into
  which the Kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour</i>.
  <i>Now</i> while such a return from captivity was the expectation of
  <i>Israel</i>, even before the times of <i>Daniel</i>, I know not why
  <i>Daniel</i> should omit it in his Prophecy. This part of the Prophecy
  being therefore not yet fulfilled, I shall not attempt a particular
  interpretation of it, but content myself with observing, that as the
  <i>seventy</i> and the <i>sixty two weeks</i> were <i>Jewish</i> weeks,
  ending with sabbatical years; so the <i>seven weeks</i> are the compass
  of a <i>Jubilee</i>, and begin and end with actions proper for a
  <i>Jubilee</i>, and of the highest nature for which a <i>Jubilee</i> can
  be kept: and that since <i>the commandment to return and to build
  </i>Jerusalem, precedes the <i>Messiah the Prince</i> 49 years; it may
  perhaps come forth not from the <i>Jews</i> themselves, but from some
  other kingdom friendly to them, and precede their return from captivity,
  and give occasion to it; and lastly, that this rebuilding of
  <i>Jerusalem</i> and the waste places of <i>Judah</i> is predicted in
  <i>Micah</i> vii. 11. <i>Amos</i> ix. 11, 14. <i>Ezek.</i> xxxvi. 33, 35,
  36, 38. <i>Isa.</i> liv. 3, 11, 12. lv. 12. lxi. 4. lxv. 18, 21,22. and
  <i>Tobit</i> xiv. 5. and that the return from captivity and coming of the
  <i>Messiah</i> and his kingdom are described in <i>Daniel</i> vii.
  <i>Rev.</i> xix. <i>Acts</i> i. <i>Mat.</i> xxiv. <i>Joel</i> iii.
  <i>Ezek.</i> xxxvi. xxxvii. <i>Isa.</i> lx. lxii. lxiii. lxv. and lxvi.
  and many other places of scripture. The manner I know not. Let time be
  the Interpreter.</p>

  <p><i>Yet threescore and two weeks shall it return, and the street be
  built and the wall, but in troublesome times: and after the threescore
  and two weeks the </i>Messiah<i> shall be cut off, and it shall not be
  his; but the people of a Prince to come shall destroy the city and the
  sanctuary</i>, &amp;c. Having foretold both comings of <i>Christ</i>, and
  dated the last from their returning and building <i>Jerusalem</i>; to
  prevent the applying that to the building <i>Jerusalem</i> by
  <i>Nehemiah</i>, he distinguishes this from that, by saying that from
  this period to the <i>Anointed</i> shall be, not seven weeks, but
  threescore and two weeks, and this not in prosperous but in troublesome
  times; and at the end of these Weeks the <i>Messiah</i> shall not be the
  Prince of the <i>Jews</i>, but be cut off; and <i>Jerusalem</i> not be
  his, but the city and sanctuary be destroyed. Now <i>Nehemiah</i> came to
  <i>Jerusalem</i> in the 20th year of this same <i>Artaxerxes</i>, while
  <i>Ezra</i> still continued there, <i>Nehem.</i> xii. 36, and found the
  city lying waste, and the houses and wall unbuilt, <i>Nehem.</i> ii. 17.
  vii. 4, and finished the wall the 25th day of the month <i>Elul</i>,
  <i>Nehem.</i> vi. 15, in the 28th year of the King, that is, in
  <i>September</i> in the year of the <i>Julian Period</i> 4278. Count now
  from this year threescore and two weeks of years, that is 434 years, and
  the reckoning will end in <i>September</i> in the year of the <i>Julian
  Period</i> 4712 which is the year in which <i>Christ</i> was born,
  according to <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>, <i>Irenæus</i>,
  <i>Eusebius</i>, <i>Epiphanius</i>, <i>Jerome</i>, <i>Orosius</i>,
  <i>Cassiodorus</i>, and other antients; and this was the general opinion,
  till <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i> invented the vulgar account, in which
  <i>Christ</i>'s birth is placed two years later. If with some you reckon
  that <i>Christ</i> was born three or four years before the vulgar
  account, yet his birth will fall in the latter part of the last week,
  which is enough. How after these weeks <i>Christ</i> was cut off and the
  city and sanctuary destroyed by the <i>Romans</i>, is well known.</p>

  <p><i>Yet shall he confirm the covenant with many for one week.</i> He
  kept it, notwithstanding his death, till the rejection of the
  <i>Jews</i>, and calling of <i>Cornelius</i> and the <i>Gentiles</i> in
  the seventh year after his passion.</p>

  <p><i>And in half a week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to
  cease</i>; that is, by the war of the <i>Romans</i> upon the <i>Jews</i>:
  which war, after some commotions, began in the 13th year of <i>Nero</i>,
  A.D. 67, in the spring, when <i>Vespasian</i> with an army invaded them;
  and ended in the second year of <i>Vespasian</i>, A.D. 70, in autumn,
  <i>Sept.</i> 7, when <i>Titus</i> took the city, having burnt the Temple
  27 days before: so that it lasted three years and an half.</p>

  <p><i>And upon a wing of abominations he shall cause desolation, even
  until the consummation, and that which is determined be poured upon the
  desolate.</i> The Prophets, in representing kingdoms by Beasts and Birds,
  put their wings stretcht out over any country for their armies sent out
  to invade and rule over that country. Hence a wing of abominations is an
  army of false Gods: for an abomination is often put in scripture for a
  false God; as where <i>Chemosh</i> is called <a name="NtpDanX_10"
  href="#NtDanX_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> the abomination of <i>Moab</i>, and
  <i>Molech</i> the abomination of <i>Ammon</i>. The meaning therefore is,
  that the people of a Prince to come shall destroy the sanctuary, and
  abolish the daily worship of the true God, and overspread the land with
  an army of false gods; and by setting up their dominion and worship,
  cause desolation to the <i>Jews</i>, until the times of the
  <i>Gentiles</i> be fulfilled. For <i>Christ</i> tells us, that the
  abomination of desolation spoken of by <i>Daniel</i> was to be set up in
  the times of the <i>Roman Empire</i>, <i>Matth.</i> xxiv. 15.</p>

  <p>Thus have we in this short Prophecy, a prediction of all the main
  periods relating to the coming of the <i>Messiah</i>; the time of his
  birth, that of his death, that of the rejection of the <i>Jews</i>, the
  duration of the <i>Jewish</i> war whereby he caused the city and
  sanctuary to be destroyed, and the time of his second coming: and so the
  interpretation here given is more full and complete and adequate to the
  design, than if we should restrain it to his first coming only, as
  Interpreters usually do. We avoid also the doing violence to the language
  of <i>Daniel</i>, by taking the <i>seven weeks</i> and <i>sixty two
  weeks</i> for one number. Had that been <i>Daniel</i>'s meaning, he would
  have said <i>sixty and nine weeks</i>, and not <i>seven weeks</i> and
  <i>sixty two weeks</i>, a way of numbring used by no nation. In our way
  the years are <i>Jewish Luni-solar years</i>, <a name="NtpDanX_11"
  href="#NtDanX_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> as they ought to be; and the
  <i>seventy weeks of years</i> are <i>Jewish weeks</i> ending with
  <i>sabbatical years</i>, which is very remarkable. For they end either
  with the year of the birth of <i>Christ</i>, two years before the vulgar
  account, or with the year of his death, or with the seventh year after
  it: all which are <i>sabbatical years</i>. Others either count by Lunar
  years, or by weeks not <i>Judaic</i>: and, which is worst, they ground
  their interpretations on erroneous Chronology, excepting the opinion of
  <i>Funccius</i> about the <i>seventy weeks</i>, which is the same with
  ours. For they place <i>Ezra</i> and <i>Nehemiah</i> in the reign of
  <i>Artaxerxes Mnemon</i>, and the building of the Temple in the reign of
  <i>Darius Nothus</i>, and date the weeks of <i>Daniel</i> from those two
  reigns.</p>

  <p>The grounds of the Chronology here followed, I will now set down as
  briefly as I can.</p>

  <p>The <i>Peloponnesian</i> war began in spring <i>An.</i> 1
  <i>Olymp.</i> 87, as <i>Diodorus</i>, <i>Eusebius</i>, and all other
  authors agree. It began two months before <i>Pythodorus</i> ceased to be
  <i>Archon</i>, <i>Thucyd.</i> <i>l.</i> 2. that is, in <i>April</i>, two
  months before the end of the <i>Olympic</i> year. Now the years of this
  war are most certainly determined by the 50 years distance of its first
  year from the transit of <i>Xerxes</i> inclusively, <i>Thucyd.</i>
  <i>l.</i> 2. or 48 years exclusively, <i>Eratosth. apud Clem. Alex.</i>
  by the 69 years distance of its end, or 27th year, from the beginning of
  <i>Alexander</i>'s reign in <i>Greece</i>; by the acting of the
  <i>Olympic</i> games in its 4th and 12th years, <i>Thucyd.</i> <i>l.</i>
  5; and by three eclipses of the sun, and one of the moon, mentioned by
  <i>Thucydides</i> and <i>Xenophon</i>. Now <i>Thucydides</i>, an
  unquestionable witness, tells us, that the news of the death of
  <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i> was brought to <i>Ephesus</i>, and from
  thence by some <i>Athenians</i> to <i>Athens</i>, in the 7th year of this
  <i>Peloponnesian</i> war, when the winter half year was running; and
  therefore he died <i>An.</i> 4 <i>Olymp.</i> 88, in the end of <i>An.
  J.P.</i> 4289, suppose a month or two before midwinter; for so long the
  news would be in coming. Now <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i> reigned 40
  years, by the consent of <i>Diodorus</i>, <i>Eusebius</i>, <i>Jerome</i>,
  <i>Sulpitius</i>; or 41, according to <i>Ptol. in can. Clem. Alexand.</i>
  <i>l.</i> 1. <i>Strom. Chron. Alexandr</i>. <i>Abulpharagius</i>,
  <i>Nicephorus</i>, including therein the reign of his successors
  <i>Xerxes</i> and <i>Sogdian</i>, as <i>Abulpharagius</i> informs us.
  After <i>Artaxerxes</i> reigned his son <i>Xerxes</i> two months, and
  <i>Sogdian</i> seven months; but their reign is not reckoned apart in
  summing up the years of the Kings, but is included in the 40 or 41 years
  reign of <i>Artaxerxes</i>: omit these nine months, and the precise reign
  of <i>Artaxerxes</i> will be thirty nine years and three months. And
  therefore since his reign ended in the beginning of winter <i>An.
  J.P.</i> 4289, it began between midsummer and autumn, <i>An. J.P.</i>
  4250.</p>

  <p>The same thing I gather also thus. <i>Cambyses</i> began his reign in
  spring <i>An. J.P.</i> 4185, and reigned eight years, including the five
  months of <i>Smerdes</i>; and then <i>Darius Hystaspis</i> began in
  spring <i>An. J.P.</i> 4193, and reigned thirty six years, by the
  unanimous consent of all Chronologers. The reigns of these two Kings are
  determined by three eclipses of the moon observed at <i>Babylon</i>, and
  recorded by <i>Ptolemy</i>; so that it cannot be disputed. One was in the
  seventh year of <i>Cambyses</i>, <i>An. J.P.</i> 4191, <i>Jul.</i> 16, at
  11 at night; another in the 20th year of <i>Darius</i>, <i>An. J.P.</i>
  4212, <i>Nov.</i> 19, at 11<sup>h.</sup> 45' at night; a third in the
  31st year of <i>Darius</i>, <i>An. J.P.</i> 4223, <i>Apr.</i> 25, at
  11<sup>h.</sup> 30 at night. By these eclipses, and the Prophecies of
  <i>Haggai</i> and <i>Zechary</i> compared together, it is manifest that
  his years began after the 24th day of the 11th <i>Jewish</i> month, and
  before the 25th day of <i>April</i>, and by consequence about
  <i>March</i>. <i>Xerxes</i> therefore began in spring <i>An. J.P.</i>
  4229: for <i>Darius</i> died in the fifth year after the battle at
  <i>Marathon</i>, as <i>Herodotus</i>, <i>lib.</i> 7, and <i>Plutarch</i>
  mention; and that battle was in <i>October</i> <i>An. J.P.</i> 4224, ten
  years before the battle at <i>Salamis</i>. <i>Xerxes</i> therefore began
  within less than a year after <i>October</i> <i>An. J.P.</i> 4228,
  suppose in the spring following: for he spent his first five years, and
  something more, in preparations for his expedition against the
  <i>Greeks</i>; and this expedition was in the time of the <i>Olympic</i>
  games, <i>An.</i> 1 <i>Olymp.</i> 75, <i>Calliade Athenis Archonte</i>,
  28 years after the <i>Regifuge</i>, and Consulship of the first Consul
  <i>Junius Brutus</i>, <i>Anno Urbis conditæ</i> 273, <i>Fabio &amp; Furio
  Coss.</i> The passage of <i>Xerxes</i>'s army over the <i>Hellespont</i>
  began in the end of the fourth year of the 74th <i>Olympiad</i>, that is,
  in <i>June</i> <i>An. J.P.</i> 4234, and took up one month: and in
  autumn, three months after, on the full moon, the 16th day of the month
  <i>Munychion</i>, was the battle at <i>Salamis</i>, and a little after
  that an eclipse of the sun, which by the calculation fell on
  <i>Octob.</i> 2. His sixth year therefore began a little before
  <i>June</i>, suppose in spring <i>An. J.P.</i> 4234, and his first year
  consequently in spring <i>An. J.P.</i> 4229, as above. Now he reigned
  almost twenty one years, by the consent of all writers. Add the 7 months
  of <i>Artabanus</i>, and the sum will be 21 years and about four or five
  months, which end between midsummer and autumn <i>An. J.P.</i> 4250. At
  this time therefore began the reign of his successor <i>Artaxerxes</i>,
  as was to be proved.</p>

  <p>The same thing is also confirmed by <i>Julius Africanus</i>, who
  informs us out of former writers, that the 20th year of this
  <i>Artaxerxes</i> was the 115th year from the beginning of the reign of
  <i>Cyrus</i> in <i>Persia,</i> and fell in with <i>An.</i> 4
  <i>Olymp.</i> 83. It began therefore with the <i>Olympic</i> year, soon
  after the summer Solstice, <i>An. J.P.</i> 4269. Subduct nineteen years,
  and his first year will begin at the same time of the year <i>An.
  J.P.</i> 4250, as above.</p>

  <p>His 7th year therefore began after midsummer <i>An. J.P.</i> 4256; and
  the Journey of <i>Ezra</i> to <i>Jerusalem</i> in the spring following
  fell on the beginning of <i>An. J.P.</i> 4257, as above.</p>

  years of the eastern nations consisted of 12 months, and every month of
  30 days: and hence came the division of a circle into 360 degrees. This
  year seems to be used by <i>Moses</i> in his history of the Flood, and by
  <i>John</i> in the <i>Apocalypse</i>, where a time, times and half a
  time, 42 months and 1260 days, are put equipollent. But in reckoning by
  many of these years together, an account is to be kept of the odd days
  which were added to the end of these years. For the <i>Egyptians</i>
  added five days to the end of this year; and so did the <i>Chaldeans</i>
  long before the times of <i>Daniel</i>, as appears by the <i>Æra</i>, of
  <i>Nabonassar</i>: and the <i>Persian</i> Magi used the same year of 365
  days, till the Empire of the <i>Arabians</i>. The antient <i>Greeks</i>
  also used the same solar year of 12 equal months, or 360 days; but every
  other year added an intercalary month, consisting of 10 and 11 days
  alternately.</p>

  <p>The year of the <i>Jews</i>, even from their coming out of
  <i>Egypt</i>, was Luni-solar. It was solar, for the harvest always
  followed the Passover, and the fruits of the land were always gathered
  before the feast of Tabernacles, <i>Levit.</i> xxiii. But the months were
  lunar, for the people were commanded by <i>Moses</i> in the beginning of
  every month to blow with trumpets, and offer burnt offerings with their
  drink offerings, <i>Num.</i> x. 10. xxviii. 11, 14. and this solemnity
  was kept on the new moons, <i>Psal.</i> lxxxi. 3,4,5. 1 <i>Chron.</i>
  xxiii. 31. These months were called by <i>Moses</i> the first, second,
  third, fourth month, <i>&amp;c.</i> and the first month was also called
  <i>Abib</i>, the second <i>Zif</i>, the seventh <i>Ethanim</i>, the
  eighth <i>Bull</i>, <i>Exod.</i> xiii. 4. 1 <i>Kings</i> vi. 37, 38.
  viii. 2. But in the <i>Babylonian</i> captivity the <i>Jews</i> used the
  names of the <i>Chaldean</i> months, and by those names understood the
  months of their own year; so that the <i>Jewish</i> months then lost
  their old names, and are now called by those of the <i>Chaldeans</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Jews</i> began their civil year from the autumnal Equinox, and
  their sacred year from the vernal: and the first day of the first month
  was on the visible new moon, which was nearest the Equinox.</p>

  <p>Whether <i>Daniel</i> used the <i>Chaldaick</i> or <i>Jewish</i> year,
  is not very material; the difference being but six hours in a year, and 4
  months in 480 years. But I take his months to be <i>Jewish</i>: first,
  because <i>Daniel</i> was a <i>Jew</i>, and the <i>Jews</i> even by the
  names of the <i>Chaldean</i> months understood the months of their own
  year: secondly, because this Prophecy is grounded on <i>Jeremiah</i>'s
  concerning the 70 years captivity, and therefore must be understood of
  the same sort of years with the seventy; and those are <i>Jewish</i>,
  since that Prophecy was given in <i>Judea</i> before the captivity: and
  lastly, because <i>Daniel</i> reckons by weeks of years, which is a way
  of reckoning peculiar to the <i>Jewish</i> years. For as their days ran
  by sevens, and the last day of every seven was a sabbath; so their years
  ran by sevens, and the last year of every seven was a sabbatical year,
  and seven such weeks of years made a <i>Jubilee</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="DanXI">CHAP. XI</a>.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the Times of the Birth and Passion
of </i>Christ.</p>

  <p>The times of the Birth and Passion of <i>Christ</i>, with such like
  niceties, being not material to religion, were little regarded by the
  <i>Christians</i> of the first age. They who began first to celebrate
  them, placed them in the cardinal periods of the year; as the
  annunciation of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, on the 25th of <i>March</i>,
  which when <i>Julius Cæsar</i> corrected the Calendar was the vernal
  Equinox; the feast of <i>John</i> Baptist on the 24th of <i>June</i>,
  which was the summer Solstice; the feast of St. <i>Michael</i> on
  <i>Sept.</i> 29, which was the autumnal Equinox; and the birth of
  <i>Christ</i> on the winter Solstice, <i>Decemb.</i> 25, with the feasts
  of St. <i>Stephen</i>, St. <i>John</i> and the <i>Innocents</i>, as near
  it as they could place them. And because the Solstice in time removed
  from the 25th of <i>December</i> to the 24th, the 23d, the 22d, and so on
  backwards, hence some in the following centuries placed the birth of
  <i>Christ</i> on <i>Decemb.</i> 23, and at length on <i>Decemb.</i> 20:
  and for the same reason they seem to have set the feast of St.
  <i>Thomas</i> on <i>Decemb.</i> 21, and that of St. <i>Matthew</i> on
  <i>Sept.</i> 21. So also at the entrance of the Sun into all the signs in
  the <i>Julian</i> Calendar, they placed the days of other Saints; as the
  conversion of <i>Paul</i> on <i>Jan.</i> 25, when the Sun entred <img
  src="images/aquarius.png" alt="Aquarius" />; St. <i>Matthias</i> on
  <i>Feb.</i> 25, when he entred <img src="images/pisces.png" alt="Pisces"
  />; St. <i>Mark</i> on <i>Apr.</i> 25, when he entred <img
  src="images/taurus.png" alt="Taurus" />; <i>Corpus Christi</i> on
  <i>May</i> 26, when he entred <img src="images/gemini.png" alt="Gemini"
  />; St. <i>James</i> on <i>July</i> 25, when he entred <img
  src="images/cancer.png" alt="Cancer" />; St. <i>Bartholomew</i> on
  <i>Aug.</i> 24, when he entred <img src="images/virgo.png" alt="Virgo"
  />; <i>Simon</i> and <i>Jude</i> on <i>Octob.</i> 28, when he entred <img
  src="images/scorpio.png" alt="Scorpio" />: and if there were any other
  remarkable days in the <i>Julian</i> Calendar, they placed the Saints
  upon them, as St. <i>Barnabas</i> on <i>June</i> 11, where <i>Ovid</i>
  seems to place the feast of <i>Vesta</i> and <i>Fortuna</i>, and the
  goddess <i>Matuta</i>; and St. <i>Philip</i> and <i>James</i> on the
  first of <i>May</i>, a day dedicated both to the <i>Bona Dea</i>, or
  <i>Magna Mater</i>, and to the goddess <i>Flora</i>, and still celebrated
  with her rites. All which shews that these days were fixed in the first
  <i>Christian</i> Calendars by Mathematicians at pleasure, without any
  ground in tradition; and that the <i>Christians</i> afterwards took up
  with what they found in the Calendars.</p>

  <p>Neither was there any certain tradition about the years of
  <i>Christ</i>. For the <i>Christians</i> who first began to enquire into
  these things, as <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>, <i>Origen</i>,
  <i>Tertullian</i>, <i>Julius Africanus</i>, <i>Lactantius</i>,
  <i>Jerome</i>, St. <i>Austin</i>, <i>Sulpicius Severus</i>,
  <i>Prosper</i>, and as many as place the death of <i>Christ</i> in the
  15th or 16th year of <i>Tiberius</i>, make <i>Christ</i> to have preached
  but one year, or at most but two. At length <i>Eusebius</i> discovered
  four successive Passovers in the Gospel of <i>John</i>, and thereupon set
  on foot an opinion that he preacht three years and an half; and so died
  in the 19th year of <i>Tiberius</i>. Others afterwards, finding the
  opinion that he died in the Equinox <i>Mar.</i> 25, more consonant to the
  times of the <i>Jewish</i> Passover, in the 17th and 20th years, have
  placed his death in one of those two years. Neither is there any greater
  certainty in the opinions about the time of his birth. The first
  <i>Christians</i> placed his baptism near the beginning of the 15th year
  of <i>Tiberius</i>; and thence reckoning thirty years backwards, placed
  his birth in the 43d <i>Julian</i> year, the 42d of <i>Augustus</i> and
  28th of the <i>Actiac</i> victory. This was the opinion which obtained in
  the first ages, till <i>Dionysius Exiguus</i>, placing the baptism of
  <i>Christ</i> in the 16th year of <i>Tiberius</i>, and misinterpreting
  the text of <i>Luke</i>, iii. 23. as if <i>Jesus</i> was only beginning
  to be 30 years old when he was baptized, invented the vulgar account, in
  which his birth is placed two years later than before. As therefore
  relating to these things there is no tradition worth considering; let us
  lay aside all and examine what prejudices can be gathered from records of
  good account.</p>

  <p>The fifteenth year of <i>Tiberius</i> began <i>Aug.</i> 28, <i>An.
  J.P.</i> 4727. So soon as the winter was over, and the weather became
  warm enough, we may reckon that <i>John</i> began to baptize; and that
  before next winter his fame went abroad, and all the people came to his
  baptism, and <i>Jesus</i> among the rest. Whence the first Passover after
  his baptism mentioned <i>John</i> ii. 13. was in the 16th year of
  <i>Tiberius</i>. After this feast <i>Jesus</i> came into the land of
  <i>Judea</i>, and staid there baptizing, whilst <i>John</i> was baptizing
  in <i>Ænon</i>, <i>John</i> iii. 22, 23. But when he heard that
  <i>John</i> was cast into prison, he departed into <i>Galilee</i>,
  <i>Mat.</i> iii. 12. being afraid, because the Pharisees had heard that
  he baptized more disciples than <i>John</i>, <i>John</i> iv. 1. and in
  his journey he passed thro' <i>Samaria</i> four months before the
  harvest, <i>John</i> iv. 35. that is, about the time of the winter
  Solstice. For their harvest was between <i>Easter</i> and
  <i>Whitsunday</i>, and began about a month after the vernal Equinox.
  <i>Say not ye</i>, saith he, <i>there are yet four months, and then
  cometh harvest? Behold I say unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the
  fields, for they are white already to harvest</i>; meaning, that the
  people in the fields were ready for the Gospel, as his next words shew<a
  name="NtpDanXI_1" href="#NtDanXI_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. <i>John</i>
  therefore was imprisoned about <i>November</i>, in the 17th year of
  <i>Tiberius</i>; and <i>Christ</i> thereupon went from <i>Judea</i> to
  <i>Cana</i> of <i>Galilee</i> in <i>December</i>, and was received there
  of the <i>Galileans</i>, who had seen all he did at <i>Jerusalem</i> at
  the Passover: and when a Nobleman of <i>Capernaum</i> heard he was
  returned into <i>Galilee</i>, and went to him and desired him to come and
  cure his son, he went not thither yet, but only said, <i>Go thy way, thy
  son liveth; and the Nobleman returned and found it so, and believed, he
  and his house</i>, John iv. This is the beginning of his miracles in
  <i>Galilee</i>; and thus far <i>John</i> is full and distinct in relating
  the actions of his first year, omitted by the other Evangelists. The rest
  of his history is from this time related more fully by the other
  Evangelists than by <i>John</i>; for what they relate he omits.</p>

  <p>From this time therefore <i>Jesus</i> taught in the Synagogues of
  <i>Galilee</i> on the sabbath-days, being glorified of all: and coming to
  his own city <i>Nazareth</i>, and preaching in their Synagogue, they were
  offended, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the
  hill on which the city was built to cast him headlong; but he passing
  thro' the midst of them, went his way, and came and dwelt at
  <i>Capernaum</i>, <i>Luke</i> iv. And by this time we may reckon the
  second Passover was either past or at hand.</p>

  <p>All this time <i>Matthew</i> passeth over in few words, and here
  begins to relate the preaching and miracles of <i>Christ</i>. <i>When
  </i>Jesus, saith he, <i>had heard that </i>John<i> was cast into prison,
  he departed into </i>Galilee<i>; and leaving </i>Nazareth<i>, he came and
  dwelt at </i>Capernaum<i>, and from that time began to preach and say,
  Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand</i>, Matth. iv. 12.
  Afterwards he called his disciples <i>Peter</i>, <i>Andrew</i>,
  <i>James</i> and <i>John</i>; and then <i>went about all</i> Galilee,
  <i>teaching in the Synagogues,&mdash;and healing all manner of
  sickness:&mdash;and his fame went thro'out all </i>Syria<i>; and they
  brought unto him all sick people,&mdash;and there followed him great
  multitudes of people from </i>Galilee<i>, and from </i>Decapolis<i>, and
  from </i>Jerusalem<i>, and from </i>Judea<i>, and from beyond </i>Jordan,
  Matth, iv. 18, 25. All this was done before the sermon in the mount: and
  therefore we may certainly reckon that the second Passover was past
  before the preaching of that sermon. The multitudes that followed him
  from <i>Jerusalem</i> and <i>Judea</i>, shew that he had lately been
  there at the feast. The sermon in the mount was made when great
  multitudes came to him from all places, and followed him in the open
  fields; which is an argument of the summer-season: and in this sermon he
  pointed at the lilies of the field then in the flower before the eyes of
  his auditors. <i>Consider</i>, saith he, <i>the lilies of the field, how
  they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet </i>Solomon<i> in
  all his glory was not arayed like one of these. Wherefore if God so
  clothe the grass of the field, which to day is and to morrow is cast into
  the oven</i>, &amp;c. <i>Matth.</i> vi. 28. So therefore the grass of the
  field was now in the flower, and by consequence the month of <i>March</i>
  with the Passover was past.</p>

  <p>Let us see therefore how the rest of the feasts follow in order in
  <i>Matthew</i>'s Gospel: for he was an eye-witness of what he relates,
  and so tells all things in due order of time, which <i>Mark</i> and
  <i>Luke</i> do not.</p>

  <p>Some time after the sermon in the mount, when the time came that he
  should be received, that is, when the time of a feast came that he should
  be received by the <i>Jews</i>, he set his face to go to
  <i>Jerusalem</i>: and as he went with his disciples in the way, when the
  <i>Samaritans</i> in his passage thro' <i>Samaria</i> had denied him
  lodgings, and a certain Scribe said unto him, <i>Master, I will follow
  thee whithersoever thou goest</i>, Jesus <i>said unto him, The foxes have
  holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not
  where to lay his head</i>, Matth. viii. 19. Luke ix. 51, 57. The Scribe
  told <i>Christ</i> he would bear him company in his journey, and
  <i>Christ</i> replied that he wanted a lodging. Now this feast I take to
  be the feast of Tabernacles, because soon after I find <i>Christ</i> and
  his Apostles on the sea of <i>Tiberias</i> in a storm so great, that the
  ship was covered with water and in danger of sinking, till <i>Christ
  rebuked the winds and the sea</i>, Matth. viii. 23. For this storm shews
  that winter was now come on.</p>

  <p>After this <i>Christ</i> did many miracles, and <i>went about all the
  cities and villages of </i>Galilee<i>, teaching in their Synagogues, and
  preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness, and
  every disease among the people</i>, Matth. ix. he then sent forth the
  twelve to do the like, <i>Matth.</i> x. and at length when he had
  received a message from <i>John</i>, and answered it, he said to the
  multitudes, <i>From the days of </i>John<i> the Baptist until now the
  kingdom of heaven suffereth violence</i>; and upbraided the cities,
  <i>Chorazin</i>, <i>Bethsaida</i>, and <i>Capernaum</i>, wherein most of
  his mighty works were done, because they repented not, <i>Matth.</i> xi.
  Which several passages shew, that from the imprisonment of <i>John</i>
  till now there had been a considerable length of time: the winter was now
  past, and the next Passover was at hand; for immediately after this,
  <i>Matthew</i>, in chap. xii. subjoins, that <i>Jesus went on the
  sabbath-day thro' the corn, and his disciples were an hungred, and began
  to pluck the ears of corn and to eat,&mdash;rubbing them</i>, saith
  <i>Luke</i>, <i>in their hands</i>: the corn therefore was not only in
  the ear, but ripe; and consequently the Passover, in which the
  first-fruits were always offered before the harvest, was now come or
  past. <i>Luke</i> calls this sabbath <span lang="el"
  title="deuteroprôton"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>,
  the second prime sabbath, that is, the second of the two great feasts of
  the Passover. As we call <i>Easter</i> day high <i>Easter</i>, and its
  <i>octave</i> low <i>Easter</i> or <i>Lowsunday</i>: so <i>Luke</i> calls
  the feast on the seventh day of the unlevened bread, the second of the
  two prime sabbaths.</p>

  <p>In one of the sabbaths following he went into a Synagogue, and healed
  a man with a withered hand, <i>Matth.</i> xii. 9. <i>Luke</i> vi. 6. And
  when the Pharisees took counsel to destroy him, <i>he withdrew himself
  from thence, and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,
  and charged them that they should not make him known</i>, Matth. xii. 14.
  Afterwards being in a ship, and the multitude standing on the shore, he
  spake to them three parables together, taken from the seeds-men sowing
  the fields, <i>Matth.</i> xiii. by which we may know that it was now
  seed-time, and by consequence that the feast of Tabernacles was past.
  After this he went <i>into his own country, and taught them in their
  Synagogue</i>, but <i>did not many mighty works there because of their
  unbelief</i>. Then the twelve having been abroad a year, returned, and
  told <i>Jesus</i> all that they had done: and at the same time
  <i>Herod</i> beheaded <i>John</i> in prison, and his disciples came and
  told <i>Jesus</i>; and when <i>Jesus</i> heard it, he took the twelve and
  departed thence privately by ship into a desert place belonging to
  <i>Bethsaida</i>: and the people when they knew it, followed him on foot
  out of the cities, the winter being now past; and he healed their sick,
  and in the desert fed them to the number of five thousand men, besides
  women and children, with only five loaves and two fishes, <i>Matth.</i>
  xiv. <i>Luke</i> ix. at the doing of which miracle the Passover of the
  <i>Jews</i> was nigh, <i>John</i> vi. 4. But <i>Jesus</i> went not up to
  this feast; but <i>after these things walked in </i>Galilee<i>, because
  the </i>Jews at the Passover before had taken counsel to destroy him, and
  still <i>sought to kill him</i>, John vii. i. Henceforward therefore he
  is found first in the coast of <i>Tyre</i> and <i>Sidon</i>, then by the
  sea of <i>Galilee</i>, afterwards in the coast of <i>Cæsarea
  Philippi</i>; and lastly at <i>Capernaum</i>, <i>Matth.</i> xv. 21, 29.
  xvi. 13. xvii. 34.</p>

  <p>Afterwards when the feast of Tabernacles was at hand, his brethren
  upbraided him for walking secretly, and urged him to go up to the feast.
  But he went not till they were gone, and then went up privately,
  <i>John</i> vii. 2. and when the <i>Jews</i> sought to stone him, he
  escaped, <i>John</i> viii. 59. After this he was at the feast of the
  Dedication in winter, <i>John</i> x. 22. and when they sought again to
  take him, he fled beyond <i>Jordan</i>, <i>John</i> x. 39, 40.
  <i>Matth</i>. xix. 1. where he stayed till the death of <i>Lazarus</i>,
  and then came to <i>Bethany</i> near <i>Jerusalem</i>, and raised him,
  <i>John</i> xi. 7, 18. whereupon the <i>Jews</i> took counsel from that
  time to kill him: and <i>therefore</i> he <i>walked no more openly among
  the </i>Jews<i>, but went thence into a country near to the wilderness,
  into a city called </i>Ephraim<i>; and there continued with his
  disciples</i> till the last Passover, in which the <i>Jews</i> put him to
  death, <i>John</i> xi. 53, 54.</p>

  <p>Thus have we, in the Gospels of <i>Matthew</i> and <i>John</i>
  compared together, the history of <i>Christ</i>'s actions in continual
  order during five Passovers. <i>John</i> is more distinct in the
  beginning and end; <i>Matthew</i> in the middle: what either omits, the
  other supplies. The first Passover was between the baptism of
  <i>Christ</i> and the imprisonment of <i>John, John</i> ii. 13. the
  second within four months after the imprisonment of <i>John</i>, and
  <i>Christ</i>'s beginning to preach in <i>Galilee</i>, <i>John</i> iv.
  35. and therefore it was either that feast to which <i>Jesus</i> went up,
  when the Scribe desired to follow him, <i>Matth.</i> viii. 19.
  <i>Luke</i> ix. 51, 57. or the feast before it. The third was the next
  feast after it, when the corn was eared and ripe, <i>Matth</i>, xii. 1.
  <i>Luke</i> vi. 1. The fourth was that which was nigh at hand when
  <i>Christ</i> wrought the miracle of the five loaves, <i>Matth</i>. xiv.
  15. <i>John</i> vi. 4, 5. and the fifth was that in which <i>Christ</i>
  suffered, <i>Matth.</i> xx. 17. <i>John</i> xii. 1.</p>

  <p>Between the first and second Passover <i>John</i> and <i>Christ</i>
  baptized together, till the imprisonment of <i>John</i>, which was four
  months before the second. Then <i>Christ</i> began to preach, and call
  his disciples; and after he had instructed them a year, lent them to
  preach in the cities of the <i>Jews</i>: at the same time <i>John</i>
  hearing of the fame of <i>Christ</i>, sent to him to know who he was. At
  the third, the chief Priests began to consult about the death of
  <i>Christ</i>. A little before the fourth, the twelve after they had
  preached a year in all the cities, returned to <i>Christ</i>; and at the
  same time <i>Herod</i> beheaded <i>John</i> in prison, after he had been
  in prison two years and a quarter: and thereupon <i>Christ</i> fled into
  the desart for fear of <i>Herod</i>. The fourth <i>Christ</i> went not up
  to <i>Jerusalem</i> for fear of the <i>Jews</i>, who at the Passover
  before had consulted his death, and because his time was not yet come.
  Thenceforward therefore till the feast of Tabernacles he walked in
  <i>Galilee</i>, and that secretly for fear of <i>Herod</i>: and after the
  feast of Tabernacles he returned no more into <i>Galilee</i>, but
  sometimes was at <i>Jerusalem</i>, and sometimes retired beyond
  <i>Jordan</i>, or to the city <i>Ephraim</i> by the wilderness, till the
  Passover in which he was betrayed, apprehended, and crucified.</p>

  <p><i>John</i> therefore baptized two summers, and <i>Christ</i> preached
  three. The first summer <i>John</i> preached to make himself known, in
  order to give testimony to <i>Christ</i>. Then, after <i>Christ</i> came
  to his baptism and was made known to him, he baptized another summer, to
  make <i>Christ</i> known by his testimony; and <i>Christ</i> also
  baptized the same summer, to make himself the more known: and by reason
  of <i>John</i>'s testimony there came more to <i>Christ</i>'s baptism
  than to <i>John</i>'s. The winter following <i>John</i> was imprisoned;
  and now his course being at an end, <i>Christ</i> entered upon his proper
  office of preaching in the cities. In the beginning of his preaching he
  completed the number of the twelve Apostles, and instructed them all the
  first year in order to send them abroad. Before the end of this year, his
  fame by his preaching and miracles was so far spread abroad, that the
  <i>Jews</i> at the Passover following consulted how to kill him. In the
  second year of his preaching, it being no longer safe for him to converse
  openly in <i>Judea</i>, he sent the twelve to preach in all their cities:
  and in the end of the year they returned to him, and told him all they
  had done. All the last year the twelve continued with him to be
  instructed more perfectly, in order to their preaching to all nations
  after his death. And upon the news of <i>John</i>'s death, being afraid
  of <i>Herod</i> as well as of the <i>Jews</i>, he walked this year more
  secretly than before; frequenting desarts, and spending the last half of
  the year in <i>Judea</i>, without the dominions of <i>Herod</i>.</p>

  <p>Thus have we in the Gospels of <i>Matthew</i> and <i>John</i> all
  things told in due order, from the beginning of <i>John</i>'s preaching
  to the death of <i>Christ</i>, and the years distinguished from one
  another by such essential characters that they cannot be mistaken. The
  second Passover is distinguished from the first, by the interposition of
  <i>John</i>'s imprisonment. The third is distinguished from the second,
  by a double character: first, by the interposition of the feast to which
  <i>Christ</i> went up, <i>Mat.</i> viii. 19. <i>Luke</i> ix. 57. and
  secondly, by the distance of time from the beginning of <i>Christ</i>'s
  preaching: for the second was in the beginning of his preaching, and the
  third so long after, that before it came <i>Christ</i> said, <i>from the
  days of </i>John<i> the Baptist until now</i>, &amp;c. and upbraided the
  cities of <i>Galilee</i> for their not repenting at his preaching, and
  mighty works done in all that time. The fourth is distinguished from the
  third, by the mission of the twelve from <i>Christ</i> to preach in the
  cities of <i>Judea</i> in all the interval. The fifth is distinguished
  from all the former by the twelve's being returned from preaching, and
  continuing with <i>Christ</i> during all the interval, between the fourth
  and fifth, and by the passion and other infallible characters.</p>

  <p>Now since the first summer of <i>John</i>'s baptizing fell in the
  fifteenth year of the Emperor <i>Tiberius</i>, and by consequence the
  first of these five Passovers in his sixteenth year; the last of them, in
  which <i>Jesus</i> suffered, will fall on the twentieth year of the same
  Emperor; and by consequence in the Consulship of <i>Fabius</i> and
  <i>Vitellius</i>, in the 79th <i>Julian</i> year, and year of
  <i>Christ</i> 34, which was the sabbatical year of the <i>Jews</i>. And
  that it did so, I further confirm by these arguments.</p>

  <p>I take it for granted that the passion was on friday the 14th day of
  the month <i>Nisan</i>, the great feast of the Passover on saturday the
  15th day of <i>Nisan</i>, and the resurrection on the day following. Now
  the 14th day of <i>Nisan</i> always fell on the full moon next after the
  vernal Equinox; and the month began at the new moon before, not at the
  true conjunction, but at the first appearance of the new moon: for the
  <i>Jews</i> referred all the time of the silent moon, as they phrased it,
  that is, of the moon's disappearing, to the old moon; and because the
  first appearance might usually be about 18 hours after the true
  conjunction, they therefore began their month from the sixth hour at
  evening, that is, at sun set, next after the eighteenth hour from the
  conjunction. And this rule they called <span lang="he" title="YH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5D4;</bdo></span> <i>Jah</i>, designing by the
  letters <span lang="he" title="Y" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D9;</bdo></span>
  and <span lang="he" title="H" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D4;</bdo></span> the
  number 18.</p>

  <p>I know that <i>Epiphanius</i> tells us, if some interpret his words
  rightly, that the <i>Jews</i> used a vicious cycle, and thereby
  anticipated the legal new moons by two days. But this surely he spake not
  as a witness, for he neither understood <i>Astronomy</i> nor
  <i>Rabbinical</i> learning, but as arguing from his erroneous hypothesis
  about the time of the passion. For the <i>Jews</i> did not anticipate,
  but postpone their months: they thought it lawful to begin their months a
  day later than the first appearance of the new moon, because the new moon
  continued for more days than one; but not a day sooner, lest they should
  celebrate the new moon before there was any. And the <i>Jews</i> still
  keep a tradition in their books, that the <i>Sanhedrim</i> used
  diligently to define the new moons by sight: sending witnesses into
  mountainous places, and examining them about the moon's appearing, and
  translating the new moon from the day they had agreed on to the day
  before, as often as witnesses came from distant regions, who had seen it
  a day sooner than it was seen at <i>Jerusalem</i>. Accordingly
  <i>Josephus</i>, one of the <i>Jewish</i> Priests who ministred in the
  temple, tells us <a name="NtpDanXI_2"
  href="#NtDanXI_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> that the Passover was kept <i>on the
  14th day of</i> Nisan, <span lang="el" title="kata selênên"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;</span> <i>according to
  the moon, when the sun was in </i>Aries. This is confirmed also by two
  instances, recorded by him, which totally overthrow the hypothesis of the
  <i>Jews</i> using a vicious cycle. For that year in which
  <i>Jerusalem</i> was taken and destroyed, he saith, the Passover was on
  the 14th day of the month <i>Xanticus</i>, which according to
  <i>Josephus</i> is our <i>April</i>; and that five years before, it fell
  on the 8th day of the same month. Which two instances agree with the
  course of the moon.</p>

  <p>Computing therefore the new moons of the first month according to the
  course of the moon and the rule <i>Jah</i>, and thence counting 14 days,
  I find that the 14th day of this month in the year of <i>Christ</i> 31,
  fell on tuesday <i>March</i> 27; in the year 32, on sunday <i>Apr.</i>
  13; in the year 33, on friday <i>Apr.</i> 3; in the year 34, on wednesday
  <i>March</i> 24, or rather, for avoiding the Equinox which fell on the
  same day, and for having a fitter time for harvest, on thursday
  <i>Apr.</i> 22. also in the year 35, on tuesday <i>Apr.</i> 12. and in
  the year 36, on saturday <i>March</i> 31.</p>

  <p>But because the 15th and 21st days of <i>Nisan</i>, and a day or two
  of <i>Pentecost</i>, and the 10th, 15th, and 22d of <i>Tisri</i>, were
  always sabbatical days or days of rest, and it was inconvenient on two
  sabbaths together to be prohibited burying their dead and making ready
  fresh meat, for in that hot region their meat would be apt in two days to
  corrupt: to avoid these and such like inconveniences, the <i>Jews</i>
  postponed their months a day, as often as the first day of the month
  <i>Tisri</i>, or, which is all one, the third of the month <i>Nisan</i>,
  was sunday, wednesday or friday: and this rule they called <span
  lang="he" title="'DW" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D3;&#x5D5;</bdo></span>
  <i>Adu</i>, by the letters <span lang="he" title="W , D , '" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D5; , &#x5D3; , &#x5D0;</bdo></span> signifying the numbers
  1, 4, 6; that is, the 1st, 4th, and 6th days of the week; which days we
  call sunday, wednesday and friday. Postponing therefore by this rule the
  months found above; the 14th day of the month <i>Nisan</i> will fall in
  the year of <i>Christ</i> 31, on wednesday <i>March</i> 28; in the year
  32, on monday <i>Apr.</i> 14; in the year 33, on friday <i>Apr.</i> 3; in
  the year 34, on friday <i>Apr.</i> 23; in the year 35, on wednesday
  <i>Apr.</i> 13, and in the year 36, on saturday <i>March</i> 31.</p>

  <p>By this computation therefore the year 32 is absolutely excluded,
  because the Passion cannot fall on friday without making it five days
  after the full moon, or two days before it; whereas it ought to be upon
  the day of the full moon, or the next day. For the same reason the years
  31 and 35 are excluded, because in them the Passion cannot fall on
  friday, without making it three days after the full moon, or four days
  before it: errors so enormous, that they would be very conspicuous in the
  heavens to every vulgar eye. The year 36 is contended for by few or none,
  and both this and the year 35 may be thus excluded.</p>

  <p><i>Tiberius</i> in the beginning of his reign made <i>Valerius
  Gratus</i> President of <i>Judea</i>; and after 11 years, substituted
  <i>Pontius Pilate</i>, who governed 10 years. Then <i>Vitellius</i>,
  newly made President of <i>Syria</i>, deprived him of his honour,
  substituting <i>Marcellus</i>, and at length sent him to <i>Rome</i>:
  but, by reason of delays, <i>Tiberius</i> died before <i>Pilate</i> got
  thither. In the mean time <i>Vitellius</i>, after he had deposed
  <i>Pilate</i>, came to <i>Jerusalem</i> in the time of the Passover, to
  visit that Province as well as others in the beginning of his office; and
  in the place of <i>Caiaphas</i>, then High Priest, created
  <i>Jonathas</i> the son of <i>Ananus</i>, or <i>Annas</i> as he is called
  in scripture. Afterwards, when <i>Vitellius</i> was returned to
  <i>Antioch</i>, he received letters from <i>Tiberius</i>, to make peace
  with <i>Artabanus</i> king of the <i>Parthians</i>. At the same time the
  <i>Alans</i>, by the sollicitation of <i>Tiberius</i>, invaded the
  kingdom of <i>Artabanus</i>; and his subjects also, by the procurement of
  <i>Vitellius</i>, soon after rebelled: for <i>Tiberius</i> thought that
  <i>Artabanus</i>, thus pressed with difficulties, would more readily
  accept the conditions of peace. <i>Artabanus</i> therefore straightway
  gathering a greater army, opprest the rebels; and then meeting
  <i>Vitellius</i> at <i>Euphrates</i>, made a league with the
  <i>Romans</i>. After this <i>Tiberius</i> commanded <i>Vitellius</i> to
  make war upon <i>Aretas</i> King of <i>Arabia</i>. He therefore leading
  his army against <i>Aretas</i>, went together with <i>Herod</i> to
  <i>Jerusalem</i>, to sacrifice at the publick feast which was then to be
  celebrated. Where being received honourably, he stayed three days, and in
  the mean while translated the high Priesthood from <i>Jonathas</i> to his
  brother <i>Theophilus</i>: and the fourth day, receiving letters of the
  death of <i>Tiberius</i>, made the people swear allegiance to
  <i>Caius</i> the new Emperor; and recalling his army, sent them into
  quarters. All this is related by <i>Josephus</i> <i>Antiq.</i>
  <i>lib.</i> 18. <i>c.</i> 6, 7. Now <i>Tiberius</i> reigned 22 years and
  7 months, and died <i>March</i> 16, in the beginning of the year of
  <i>Christ</i> 37; and the feast of the Passover fell on <i>April</i> 20
  following, that is, 35 days after the death of <i>Tiberius</i>: so that
  there were about 36 or 38 days, for the news of his death to come from
  <i>Rome</i> to <i>Vitellius</i> at <i>Jerusalem</i>; which being a
  convenient time for that message, confirms that the feast which
  <i>Vitellius</i> and <i>Herod</i> now went up to was the Passover. For
  had it been the Pentecost, as is usually supposed, <i>Vitellius</i> would
  have continued three months ignorant of the Emperor's death: which is not
  to be supposed. However, the things done between this feast and the
  Passover which <i>Vitellius</i> was at before, namely, the stirring up a
  sedition in <i>Parthia</i>, the quieting that sedition, the making a
  league after that with the <i>Parthians</i>, the sending news of that
  league to <i>Rome</i>, the receiving new orders from thence to go against
  the <i>Arabians</i>, and the putting those orders in execution; required
  much more time than the fifty days between the Passover and Pentecost of
  the same year: and therefore the Passover which <i>Vitellius</i> first
  went up to, was in the year before. Therefore <i>Pilate</i> was deposed
  before the Passover A.C. 36, and by consequence the passion of
  <i>Christ</i> was before that Passover: for he suffered not under
  <i>Vitellius</i>, nor under <i>Vitellius</i> and <i>Pilate</i> together,
  but under <i>Pilate</i> alone.</p>

  <p>Now it is observable that the high Priesthood was at this time become
  an annual office, and the Passover was the time of making a new high
  Priest. For <i>Gratus</i> the predecessor of <i>Pilate</i>, saith
  <i>Josephus</i>, made <i>Ismael</i> high Priest after <i>Ananus</i>; and
  a while after, suppose a year, deposed him, and substituted
  <i>Eleazar</i>, and a year after <i>Simon</i>, and after another year
  <i>Caiaphas</i>; and then gave way to <i>Pilate</i>. So <i>Vitellius</i>
  at one Passover made <i>Jonathas</i> successor to <i>Caiaphas</i>, and at
  the next <i>Theophilus</i> to <i>Jonathas</i>. Hence <i>Luke</i> tells
  us, that in the 15th year of <i>Tiberius</i>, <i>Annas</i> and
  <i>Caiaphas</i> were high Priests, that is, <i>Annas</i> till the
  Passover, and <i>Caiaphas</i> afterwards. Accordingly <i>John</i> speaks
  of the high Priesthood as an annual office: for he tells us again and
  again, in the last year of <i>Christ</i>'s preaching, that
  <i>Caiaphas</i> was high Priest for that year, <i>John</i> xi. 49, 51.
  xviii. 13. And the next year <i>Luke</i> tells you, that <i>Annas</i> was
  high Priest, <i>Acts</i> iv. 6. <i>Theophilus</i> was therefore made high
  Priest in the first year of <i>Caius</i>, <i>Jonathas</i> in the 22d year
  of <i>Tiberius</i>, and <i>Caiaphas</i> in the 21st year of the same
  Emperor: and therefore, allotting a year to each, the Passion, when
  <i>Annas</i> succeeded <i>Caiaphas</i>, could not be later than the 20th
  year of <i>Tiberius</i>, A.C. 34.</p>

  <p>Thus there remain only the years 33 and 34 to be considered; and the
  year 33 I exclude by this argument. In the Passover two years before the
  Passion, when <i>Christ</i> went thro' the corn, and his disciples pluckt
  the ears, and rubbed them with their hands to eat; this ripeness of the
  corn shews that the Passover then fell late: and so did the Passover A.C.
  32, <i>April 14</i>, but the Passover A.C. 31, <i>March 28th</i>, fell
  very early. It was not therefore two years after the year 31, but two
  years after 32 that <i>Christ</i> suffered.</p>

  <p>Thus all the characters of the Passion agree to the year 34; and that
  is the only year to which they all agree.</p>

<h3>Notes to Chap. XI.</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="NtDanXI_1" href="#NtpDanXI_1">[1]</a> I observe, that
  <i>Christ</i> and his forerunner <i>John</i> in their parabolical
  discourses were wont to allude to things present. The old Prophets, when
  they would describe things emphatically, did not only draw parables from
  things which offered themselves, as from the rent of a garment, 1
  <i>Sam.</i> xv. from the sabbatic year, <i>Isa.</i> xxxvii. from the
  vessels of a Potter, <i>Jer.</i> xviii, &amp;c. but also when such fit
  objects were wanting, they supplied them by their own actions, as by
  rending a garment, 1 <i>Kings</i> xi. by shooting, 2 <i>Kings</i> xiii.
  by making bare their body, <i>Isa.</i> xx. by imposing significant names
  to their sons, <i>Isa.</i> viii. <i>Hos.</i> i. by hiding a girdle in the
  bank of <i>Euphrates</i>, <i>Jer.</i> xiii. by breaking a potter's
  vessel, <i>Jer.</i> xix. by putting on fetters and yokes, <i>Jer.</i>
  xxvii. by binding a book to a stone, and casting them both into
  <i>Euphrates</i>, <i>Jer.</i> li. by besieging a painted city,
  <i>Ezek.</i> iv. by dividing hair into three parts, <i>Ezek.</i> v. by
  making a chain, <i>Ezek.</i> vii. by carrying out houshold stuff like a
  captive and trembling, <i>Ezek.</i> xii, &amp;c. By such kind of types
  the Prophets loved to speak. And <i>Christ</i> being endued with a nobler
  prophetic spirit than the rest, excelled also in this kind of speaking,
  yet so as not to speak by his own actions, that was less grave and
  decent, but to turn into parables such things as offered themselves. On
  occasion of the harvest approaching, he admonishes his disciples once and
  again of the spiritual harvest, <i>John</i> iv. 35. <i>Matth.</i> ix. 37.
  Seeing the lilies of the field, he admonishes his disciples about gay
  clothing, <i>Matth.</i> vi. 28. In allusion to the present season of
  fruits, he admonishes his disciples about knowing men by their fruits,
  <i>Matth.</i> vii. 16. In the time of the Passover, when trees put forth
  leaves, he bids his disciples <i>learn a parable from the fig tree: when
  its branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is
  nigh</i>, &amp;c. <i>Matth.</i> xxiv. 32. <i>Luke</i> xxi. 29. The same
  day, alluding both to the season of the year and to his passion, which
  was to be two days after, he formed a parable of the time of fruits
  approaching, and the murdering of the heir, <i>Matth.</i> xxi. 33.
  Alluding at the same time, both to the money-changers whom he had newly
  driven out of the Temple, and to his passion at hand; he made a parable
  of a Noble-man going into a far country to receive a kingdom and return,
  and delivering his goods to his servants, and at his return condemning
  the slothful servant because he put not his money to the exchangers,
  <i>Matth.</i> xxv. 14. <i>Luke</i> xix. 12. Being near the Temple where
  sheep were kept in folds to be sold for the sacrifices, he spake many
  things parabolically of sheep, of the shepherd, and of the door of the
  sheepfold; and discovers that he alluded to the sheepfolds which were to
  be hired in the market-place, by speaking of such folds as a thief could
  not enter by the door, nor the shepherd himself open, but a porter opened
  to the shepherd, <i>John</i> x. 1, 3. Being in the mount of
  <i>Olives</i>, <i>Matth.</i> xxxvi. 30. <i>John</i> xiv. 31. a place so
  fertile that it could not want vines, he spake many things mystically of
  the Husbandman, and of the vine and its branches, <i>John</i> xv. Meeting
  a blind man, he admonished of spiritual blindness, <i>John</i> ix. 39. At
  the sight of little children, he described once and again the innocence
  of the elect, <i>Matth.</i> xviii. 2. xix. 13. Knowing that
  <i>Lazarus</i> was dead and should be raised again, he discoursed of the
  resurrection and life eternal, <i>John</i> xi. 25, 26. Hearing of the
  slaughter of some whom <i>Pilate</i> had slain, he admonished of eternal
  death, <i>Luke</i> xiii. 1. To his fishermen he spake of fishers of men,
  <i>Matth.</i> iv. 10. and composed another parable about fishes.
  <i>Matth.</i> xiii. 47. Being by the Temple, he spake of the Temple of
  his body, <i>John</i> ii. 19. At supper he spake a parable about the
  mystical supper to come in the kingdom of heaven, <i>Luke</i> xiv. On
  occasion of temporal food, he admonished his disciples of spiritual food,
  and of eating his flesh and drinking his blood mystically, <i>John</i>
  vi. 27, 53. When his disciples wanted bread, he bad them beware of the
  leven of the Pharisees, <i>Matth.</i> xvi. 6. Being desired to eat, he
  answered that he had other meat, <i>John</i> iv. 31. In the great day of
  the feast of Tabernacles, when the <i>Jews</i>, as their custom was,
  brought a great quantity of waters from the river <i>Shiloah</i> into the
  Temple, <i>Christ</i> stood and cried, saying, <i>If any man thirst let
  him come unto me and drink. He that believeth in me, out of his belly
  shall flow rivers of living water</i>, John vii. 37. The next day, in
  allusion to the servants who by reason of the sabbatical year were newly
  set free, he said, <i>If ye continue in my word, the truth shall make you
  free</i>. Which the <i>Jews</i> understanding literally with respect to
  the present manumission of servants, answered, <i>We be </i>Abraham<i>'s
  seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayeth thou, ye shall be
  made free?</i> John viii. They assert their freedom by a double argument:
  first, because they were the seed of <i>Abraham</i>, and therefore newly
  made free, had they been ever in bondage; and then, because they never
  were in bondage. In the last Passover, when <i>Herod</i> led his army
  thro' <i>Judea</i> against <i>Aretas</i> King of <i>Arabia</i>, because
  <i>Aretas</i> was aggressor and the stronger in military forces, as
  appeared by the event; <i>Christ</i> alluding to that state of things,
  composed the parable of a weaker King leading his army against a stronger
  who made war upon him, <i>Luke</i> xiv. 31. And I doubt not but divers
  other parables were formed upon other occasions, the history of which we
  have not.</p>

Truth.</i></p>

  <p>The kingdoms represented by the second and third Beasts, or the Bear
  and Leopard, are again described by <i>Daniel</i> in his last Prophecy
  written in the third year of <i>Cyrus</i> over <i>Babylon</i>, the year
  in which he conquered <i>Persia</i>. For this Prophecy is a commentary
  upon the Vision of the Ram and He-Goat.</p>

  <p><i>Behold</i>, saith <a name="NtpDanXII_1"
  href="#NtDanXII_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> he, <i>there shall stand up yet
  three kings in </i>Persia, [<i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Cambyses</i>, and <i>Darius
  Hystaspes</i>] <i>and the fourth</i> [<i>Xerxes</i>] <i>shall be far
  richer than they all: and by his strength thro' his riches he shall stir
  up all against the realm of </i>Grecia<i>. And a mighty king</i>
  [<i>Alexander</i> the great] <i>shall stand up, that shall rule with
  great dominion, and do according to his will. And when he shall stand up,
  his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided towards the four winds
  of heaven; and not to his posterity</i> [but after their death,] <i>nor
  according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be pluckt
  up, even for others besides those</i>. <i>Alexander</i> the great having
  conquered all the <i>Persian</i> Empire, and some part of <i>India</i>,
  died at <i>Babylon</i> a month before the summer Solstice, in the year of
  <i>Nabonassar</i> 425: and his captains gave the monarchy to his bastard
  brother <i>Philip Aridæus</i>, a man disturbed in his understanding; and
  made <i>Perdiccas</i> administrator of the kingdom. <i>Perdiccas</i> with
  their consent made <i>Meleager</i> commander of the army, <i>Seleucus</i>
  master of the horse, <i>Craterus</i> treasurer of the kingdom,
  <i>Antipater</i> governor of <i>Macedon</i> and <i>Greece</i>,
  <i>Ptolemy</i> governor of <i>Egypt</i>; <i>Antigonus</i> governor of
  <i>Pamphylia</i>, <i>Lycia</i>, <i>Lycaonia</i>, and <i>Phrygia
  major</i>; <i>Lysimachus</i> governor of <i>Thrace</i>, and other
  captains governors of other Provinces; as many as had been so before in
  the days of <i>Alexander</i> the great. The <i>Babylonians</i> began now
  to count by a new <i>Æra</i>, which they called the <i>Æra</i> of
  <i>Philip</i>, using the years of <i>Nabonassar</i>, and reckoning the
  425th year of <i>Nabonassar</i> to be the first year of <i>Philip</i>.
  <i>Roxana</i> the wife of <i>Alexander</i> being left big with child, and
  about three or four months after brought to bed of a son, they called him
  <i>Alexander</i>, saluted him King, and joined him with <i>Philip</i>,
  whom they had before placed in the throne. <i>Philip</i> reigned three
  years under the administratorship of <i>Perdiccas</i>, two years more
  under the administratorship of <i>Antipater</i>, and above a year more
  under that of <i>Polyperchon</i>; in all six years and four months; and
  then was slain with his Queen <i>Eurydice</i> in <i>September</i> by the
  command of <i>Olympias</i> the mother of <i>Alexander</i> the great. The
  <i>Greeks</i> being disgusted at the cruelties of <i>Olympias</i>,
  revolted to <i>Cassander</i> the son and successor of <i>Antipater</i>.
  <i>Cassander</i> affecting the dominion of <i>Greece</i>, slew
  <i>Olympias</i>; and soon after shut up the young king <i>Alexander</i>,
  with his mother <i>Roxana</i>, in the castle of <i>Amphipolis</i>, under
  the charge of <i>Glaucias</i>, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 432. The next year
  <i>Ptolemy</i>, <i>Cassander</i> and <i>Lysimachus</i>, by means of
  <i>Seleucus</i>, form'd a league against <i>Antigonus</i>; and after
  certain wars made peace with him, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 438, upon these
  conditions: that <i>Cassander</i> should command the forces of
  <i>Europe</i> till <i>Alexander</i> the son of <i>Roxana</i> came to age;
  and that <i>Lysimachus</i> should govern <i>Thrace</i>, <i>Ptolemy</i>
  <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Lybia</i>, and <i>Antigonus</i> all <i>Asia</i>.
  <i>Seleucus</i> had possest himself of <i>Mesopotamia</i>,
  <i>Babylonia</i>, <i>Sustana</i> and <i>Media</i>, the year before. About
  three years after <i>Alexander</i>'s death he was made governor of
  <i>Babylon</i> by <i>Antipater</i>; then was expelled by
  <i>Antigonus</i>; but now he recovered and enlarged his government over a
  great part of the <i>East</i>: which gave occasion to a new <i>Æra</i>,
  called <i>Æra Seleucidarum</i>. Not long after the peace made with
  <i>Antigonus</i>, <i>Diodorus</i> saith the same <i>Olympic</i> year;
  <i>Cassander</i>, seeing that <i>Alexander</i> the son of <i>Roxana</i>
  grew up, and that it was discoursed thro'out <i>Macedonia</i> that it was
  fit he should be set at liberty, and take upon him the government of his
  father's kingdom, commanded <i>Glaucias</i> the governor of the castle to
  kill <i>Roxana</i> and the young king <i>Alexander</i> her son, and
  conceal their deaths. Then <i>Polyperchon</i> set up <i>Hercules</i>, the
  son of <i>Alexander</i> the great by <i>Barsinè</i>, to be king; and soon
  after, at the sollicitation of <i>Cassander</i>, caused him to be slain.
  Soon after that, upon a great victory at sea got by <i>Demetrius</i> the
  son of <i>Antigonus</i> over <i>Ptolemy</i>, <i>Antigonus</i> took upon
  himself the title of king, and gave the same title to his son. This was
  <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 441. After his example, <i>Seleucus</i>,
  <i>Cassander</i>, <i>Lysimachus</i> and <i>Ptolemy</i>, took upon
  themselves the title and dignity of kings, having abstained from this
  honour while there remained any of <i>Alexander</i>'s race to inherit the
  crown. Thus the monarchy of the <i>Greeks</i> for want of an heir was
  broken into several kingdoms; four of which, seated <i>to the four winds
  of heaven</i>, were very eminent. For <i>Ptolemy</i> reigned over
  <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Lybia</i> and <i>Ethiopia</i>; <i>Antigonus</i> over
  <i>Syria</i> and the lesser <i>Asia</i>; <i>Lysimachus</i> over
  <i>Thrace</i>; and <i>Cassander</i> over <i>Macedon</i>, <i>Greece</i>
  and <i>Epirus</i>, as above.</p>

  <p><i>Seleucus</i> at this time reigned over the nations which were
  beyond <i>Euphrates</i>, and belonged to the bodies of the two first
  Beasts; but after six years he conquered <i>Antigonus</i>, and thereby
  became possest of one of the four kingdoms. For <i>Cassander</i> being
  afraid of the power of <i>Antigonus</i>, combined with <i>Lysimachus</i>,
  <i>Ptolemy</i> and <i>Seleucus</i>, against him: and while
  <i>Lysimachus</i> invaded the parts of <i>Asia</i> next the
  <i>Hellespont</i>, <i>Ptolemy</i> subdued <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and
  <i>C&#339;losyria</i>, with the sea-coasts of <i>Asia</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Seleucus</i> came down with a powerful army into <i>Cappadocia</i>,
  and joining the confederate forces, fought <i>Antigonus</i> in
  <i>Phrygia</i> and flew him, and seized his kingdom, <i>An. Nabonass.</i>
  447. After which <i>Seleucus</i> built <i>Antioch</i>, <i>Seleucia</i>,
  <i>Laodicea</i>, <i>Apamea</i>, <i>Berrhæa</i>, <i>Edessa</i>, and other
  cities in <i>Syria</i> and <i>Asia</i>; and in them granted the
  <i>Jews</i> equal privileges with the <i>Greeks</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Demetrius</i> the son of <i>Antigonus</i> retained but a small part
  of his father's dominions, and at length lost <i>Cyprus</i> to
  <i>Ptolemy</i>; but afterwards killing <i>Alexander</i>, the son and
  successor of <i>Cassander</i> king of <i>Macedon</i>, he seized his
  kingdom, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 454. Sometime after, preparing a very great
  army to recover his father's dominions in <i>Asia</i>; <i>Seleucus</i>,
  <i>Ptolemy</i>, <i>Lysimachus</i> and <i>Pyrrhus</i> king of
  <i>Epirus</i>, combined against him; and <i>Pyrrhus</i> invading
  <i>Macedon</i>, corrupted the army of <i>Demetrius</i>, put him to
  flight, seized his kingdom, and shared it with <i>Lysimachus</i>. After
  seven months, <i>Lysimachus</i> beating <i>Pyrrhus</i>, took
  <i>Macedon</i> from him, and held it five years and a half, uniting the
  kingdoms of <i>Macedon</i> and <i>Thrace</i>. <i>Lysimachus</i> in his
  wars with <i>Antigonus</i> and <i>Demetrius</i>, had taken from them
  <i>Caria</i>, <i>Lydia</i>, and <i>Phrygia</i>; and had a treasury in
  <i>Pergamus</i>, a castle on the top of a conical hill in <i>Phrygia</i>,
  by the river <i>Caicus</i>, the custody of which he had committed to one
  <i>Philetærus</i>, who was at first faithful to him, but in the last year
  of his reign revolted. For <i>Lysimachus</i>, having at the instigation
  of his wife <i>Arsinoe</i>, slain first his own son <i>Agathocles</i>,
  and then several that lamented him; the wife of <i>Agathocles</i> fled
  with her children and brothers, and some others of their friends, and
  sollicited <i>Seleucus</i> to make war upon <i>Lysimachus</i>; whereupon
  <i>Philetærus</i> also, who grieved at the death of <i>Agathocles</i>,
  and was accused thereof by <i>Arsinoe</i>, took up arms, and sided with
  <i>Seleucus</i>. On this occasion <i>Seleucus</i> and <i>Lysimachus</i>
  met and fought in <i>Phrygia</i>; and <i>Lysimachus</i> being slain in
  the battel, lost his kingdom to <i>Seleucus</i>, <i>An. Nabonass.</i>
  465. Thus the Empire of the <i>Greeks</i>, which at first brake into four
  kingdoms, became now reduced into two notable ones, henceforward called
  by <i>Daniel</i> the kings of the <i>South</i> and <i>North</i>. For
  <i>Ptolemy</i> now reigned over <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Lybia</i>,
  <i>Ethiopia</i>, <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>,
  <i>C&#339;losyria</i>, and <i>Cyprus</i>; and <i>Seleucus</i>, having
  united three of the four kingdoms, had a dominion scarce inferior to that
  of the <i>Persian</i> Empire, conquered by <i>Alexander</i> the great.
  All which is thus represented by <i>Daniel</i>:<a name="NtpDanXII_2"
  href="#NtDanXII_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>And the king of the</i> South
  [<i>Ptolemy</i>] <i>shall be strong, and one of his Princes</i>
  [<i>Seleucus</i>, one of <i>Alexander</i>'s Princes] <i>shall be strong
  above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great
  dominion</i>.</p>

  <p>After <i>Seleucus</i> had reigned seven months over <i>Macedon</i>,
  <i>Greece</i>, <i>Thrace</i>, <i>Asia</i>, <i>Syria</i>,
  <i>Babylonia</i>, <i>Media</i>, and all the <i>East</i> as far as
  <i>India</i>; <i>Ptolemy Ceraunus</i>, the younger brother of <i>Ptolemy
  Philadelphus</i> king of <i>Egypt</i>, slew him treacherously, and seized
  his dominions in <i>Europe</i>: while <i>Antiochus Soter</i>, the son of
  <i>Seleucus</i>, succeeded his father in <i>Asia</i>, <i>Syria</i>, and
  most of the <i>East</i>; and after nineteen or twenty years was succeeded
  by his son <i>Antiochus Theos</i>; who having a lasting war with
  <i>Ptolemy Philadelphus</i>, at length composed the same by marrying
  <i>Berenice</i> the daughter of <i>Philadelphus</i>: but after a reign of
  fifteen years, his first wife <i>Laodice</i> poisoned him, and set her
  son <i>Seleucus Callinicus</i> upon the throne. <i>Callinicus</i> in the
  beginning of his reign, by the impulse of his mother <i>Laodice</i>,
  besieged <i>Berenice</i> in <i>Daphne</i> near <i>Antioch</i>, and slew
  her with her young son and many of her women. Whereupon <i>Ptolemy
  Euergetes</i>, the son and successor of <i>Philadelphus</i>, made war
  upon <i>Callinicus</i>; took from him <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, <i>Syria</i>,
  <i>Cilicia</i>, <i>Mesopotamia</i>, <i>Babylonia</i>, <i>Sustana</i>, and
  some other regions; and carried back into <i>Egypt</i> 40000 talents of
  silver, and 2500 images of the Gods, amongst which were the Gods of
  <i>Egypt</i> carried away by <i>Cambyses</i>. <i>Antiochus Hierax</i> at
  first assisted his brother <i>Callinicus</i>, but afterwards contended
  with him for <i>Asia</i>. In the mean time <i>Eumenes</i> governor of
  <i>Pergamus</i> beat <i>Antiochus</i>, and took from them both all
  <i>Asia</i> westward of mount <i>Taurus</i>. This was in the fifth year
  of <i>Callinicus</i>, who after an inglorious reign of 20 years was
  succeeded by his son <i>Seleucus Ceraunus</i>; and <i>Euergetes</i> after
  four years more, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 527, was succeeded by his son
  <i>Ptolemy Philopator</i>. All which is thus signified by
  <i>Daniel</i>:<a name="NtpDanXII_3" href="#NtDanXII_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  <i>And in the end of years they</i> [the kings of the <i>South</i> and
  <i>North</i>] <i>shall join themselves together: for the king's daughter
  of the</i> South [<i>Berenice</i>] <i>shall come to the king of the
  </i>North<i> to make an agreement, but she shall not retain the power of
  the arm; neither shall she stand, nor her seed, but she shall be
  delivered up, and he</i> [<i>Callinicus</i>] <i>that brought her, and he
  whom she brought forth, and they that strengthned her in</i> [those]
  <i>times</i>, [or defended her in the siege of <i>Daphne</i>.] <i>But out
  of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his seat</i> [her brother
  <i>Euergetes</i>] <i>who shall come with an army, and shall enter into
  the fortress</i> [or fenced cities] <i>of the king of the </i>North<i>,
  and shall act against them and prevail: and shall carry captives into
  </i>Egypt<i>, their Gods with their Princes and precious vessels of
  silver and gold; and he shall continue some years after the king of
  the</i> North.</p>

  <p><i>Seleucus Ceraunus</i>, inheriting the remains of his father's
  kingdom, and thinking to recover the rest, raised a great army against
  the governor of <i>Pergamus</i>, now King thereof, but died in the third
  year of his reign. His brother and successor, <i>Antiochus Magnus</i>,
  carrying on the war, took from the King of <i>Pergamus</i> almost all the
  lesser <i>Asia</i>, recovering also the Provinces of <i>Media</i>,
  <i>Persia</i> and <i>Babylonia</i>, from the governors who had revolted:
  and in the fifth year of his reign invading <i>C&#339;losyria</i>, he
  with little opposition possest himself of a good part thereof; and the
  next year returning to invade the rest of <i>C&#339;losyria</i> and
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, beat the army of <i>Ptolemy Philopator</i> near
  <i>Berytus</i>; he then invaded <i>Palestine</i> and the neighbouring
  parts of <i>Arabia</i>, and the third year returned with an army of
  78000: but <i>Ptolemy</i> coming out of <i>Egypt</i> with an army of
  75000, fought and routed him at <i>Raphia</i> near <i>Gaza</i>, between
  <i>Palestine</i> and <i>Egypt</i>; and recovered all <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>
  and <i>C&#339;losyria</i>, <i>Ann. Nabonass.</i> 532. Being puffed up
  with this victory, and living in all manner of luxury, the
  <i>Egyptians</i> revolted, and had wars with him, but were overcome; and
  in the broils sixty thousand <i>Egyptian Jews</i> were slain. All which
  is thus described by <i>Daniel</i>: <a name="NtpDanXII_4"
  href="#NtDanXII_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <i>But his sons</i> [<i>Seleucus
  Ceraunus</i>, and <i>Antiochus Magnus</i>, the sons of <i>Callinicus</i>]
  <i>shall be stirred up, and shall gather a great army; and he</i>
  [<i>Antiochus Magnus</i>] <i>shall come effectually and overflow, and
  pass thro' and return, and</i> [again the next year] <i>be stirred up</i>
  [marching even] <i>to his fortress</i>, [the frontier towns of
  <i>Egypt</i>;] <i>and the King of the </i>South<i> shall be moved with
  choler, and come forth</i> [the third year] <i>and fight with him, even
  with the King of the </i>North<i>; and he</i> [the King of the
  <i>North</i>] <i>shall lead forth a great multitude, but the multitude
  shall be given into his hand. And the multitude being taken away, his
  heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down many ten thousands; but
  he shall not be strengthned by it: for the king of the </i>North<i> shall
  return</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>About twelve years after the battle between <i>Philopator</i> and
  <i>Antiochus</i>, <i>Philopator</i> died; and left his kingdom to his
  young son <i>Ptolemy Epiphanes</i>, a child of five years old. Thereupon
  <i>Antiochus Magnus</i> confederated with <i>Philip</i> king of
  <i>Macedon</i>, that they should each invade the dominions of
  <i>Epiphanes</i> which lay next to them. Hence arose a various war
  between <i>Antiochus</i> and <i>Epiphanes</i>, each of them seizing
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and <i>C&#339;losyria</i> by turns; whereby those
  countries were much afflicted by both parties. First <i>Antiochus</i>
  seized them; then one <i>Scopas</i> being sent with the army of
  <i>Egypt</i>, recovered them from <i>Antiochus</i>: the next year, <i>An.
  Nabonass.</i> 550, <i>Antiochus</i> fought and routed <i>Scopas</i> near
  the fountains of <i>Jordan</i>, besieged him in <i>Sidon</i>, took the
  city, and recovered <i>Syria</i> and <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> from
  <i>Egypt</i>, the <i>Jews</i> coming over to him voluntarily. But about
  three years after, preparing for a war against the <i>Romans</i>, he came
  to <i>Raphia</i> on the borders of <i>Egypt</i>; made peace with
  <i>Epiphanes</i>, and gave him his daughter <i>Cleopatra</i>: next autumn
  he passed the <i>Hellespont</i> to invade the cities of <i>Greece</i>
  under the <i>Roman</i> protection, and took some of them; but was beaten
  by the <i>Romans</i> the summer following, and forced to return back with
  his army into <i>Asia</i>. Before the end of the year the fleet of
  <i>Antiochus</i> was beaten by the fleet of the <i>Romans</i> near
  <i>Phocæa</i>: and at the same time <i>Epiphanes</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i>
  sent an embassy to <i>Rome</i> to congratulate the <i>Romans</i> on their
  success against their father <i>Antiochus</i>, and to exhort them to
  prosecute the war against him into <i>Asia</i>. The <i>Romans</i> beat
  <i>Antiochus</i> again at sea near <i>Ephesus</i>, past their army over
  the <i>Hellespont</i>, and obtain'd a great victory over him by land,
  took from him all <i>Asia</i> westward of mount <i>Taurus</i>, gave it to
  the King of <i>Pergamus</i> who assisted them in the war; and imposed a
  large tribute upon <i>Antiochus</i>. Thus the King of <i>Pergamus</i>, by
  the power of the <i>Romans</i>, recovered what <i>Antiochus</i> had taken
  from him; and <i>Antiochus</i> retiring into the remainder of his
  kingdom, was slain two years after by the <i>Persians</i>, as he was
  robbing the Temple of <i>Jupiter Belus</i> in <i>Elymais</i>, to raise
  money for the <i>Romans</i>. All which is thus described by
  <i>Daniel</i>. <a name="NtpDanXII_5"
  href="#NtDanXII_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> <i>For the King of the</i> North
  [<i>Antiochus</i>] <i>shall return, and shall set forth a multitude
  greater than the former; and shall certainly come, after certain years,
  with a great army and with much riches. And in those times there shall
  many stand up against the King of the</i> South, [particularly the
  <i>Macedonians</i>;] <i>also the robbers of thy people</i> [the
  <i>Samaritans</i>, &amp;c.] <i>shall exalt themselves to establish the
  vision, but they shall fall. So the King of the </i>North<i> shall come,
  and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities; and the arms of the
  </i>South<i> shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither
  shall there he any strength to withstand. But he that cometh against him
  shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and
  he shall stand in the glorious land, which shall fail in his hand. He
  shall also set his face to go with the strength</i> [or army] <i>of all
  his kingdom, and make an agreement with him</i> [at <i>Raphia</i>;]
  <i>and he shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her; but she
  shall not stand his side, neither be for him. After this he shall turn
  his face unto the Isles, and shall take many: but a Prince for his own
  behalf</i> [the <i>Romans</i>] <i>shall cause the reproach offered by him
  to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.
  Then he shall turn his face towards the fort of his own land: but he
  shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</i></p>

  <p><i>Seleucus Philopator</i> succeeded his father <i>Antiochus</i>,
  <i>Anno Nabonass.</i> 561, and reigned twelve years, but did nothing
  memorable, being sluggish, and intent upon raising money for the
  <i>Romans</i> to whom he was tributary. He was slain by
  <i>Heliodorus</i>, whom he had sent to rob the Temple of
  <i>Jerusalem</i>. <i>Daniel</i> thus describes his reign. <a
  name="NtpDanXII_6" href="#NtDanXII_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> <i>Then shall
  stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom, but
  within few days be shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in
  battle.</i></p>

  <p>A little before the death of <i>Philopator</i>, his son
  <i>Demetrius</i> was sent hostage to <i>Rome</i>, in the place of
  <i>Antiochus Epiphanes</i>, the brother of <i>Philopator</i>; and
  <i>Antiochus</i> was at <i>Athens</i> in his way home from <i>Rome</i>,
  when <i>Philopator</i> died: whereupon <i>Heliodorus</i> the treasurer of
  the kingdom, stept into the throne. But <i>Antiochus</i> so managed his
  affairs, that the <i>Romans</i> kept <i>Demetrius</i> at <i>Rome</i>; and
  their ally the King of <i>Pergamus</i> expelled <i>Heliodorus</i>, and
  placed <i>Antiochus</i> in the throne, while <i>Demetrius</i> the right
  heir remained an hostage at <i>Rome</i>. <i>Antiochus</i> being thus made
  King by the friendship of the King of <i>Pergamus</i> reigned powerfully
  over <i>Syria</i> and the neighbouring nations: but carried himself much
  below his dignity, stealing privately out of his palace, rambling up and
  down the city in disguise with one or two of his companions; conversing
  and drinking with people of the lowest rank, foreigners and strangers;
  frequenting the meetings of dissolute persons to feast and revel;
  clothing himself like the <i>Roman</i> candidates and officers, acting
  their parts like a mimick, and in publick festivals jesting and dancing
  with servants and light people, exposing himself by all manner of
  ridiculous gestures. This conduct made some take him for a madman, and
  call him <i>Antiochus</i> <span lang="el" title="Epimenês"
  >&#x395;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>. In the
  first year of his reign he deposed <i>Onias</i> the high-Priest, and sold
  the high-Priesthood to <i>Jason</i> the younger brother of <i>Onias</i>:
  for <i>Jason</i> had promised to give him 440 talents of silver for that
  office, and 15 more for a licence to erect a place of exercise for the
  training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen; which licence was
  granted by the King, and put in execution by <i>Jason</i>. Then the King
  sending one <i>Apollonius</i> into <i>Egypt</i> to the coronation of
  <i>Ptolemy Philometor</i>, the young son of <i>Philometor</i> and
  <i>Cleopatra</i>, and knowing <i>Philometor</i> not to be well affected
  to his affairs in <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, provided for his own safety in
  those parts; and for that end came to <i>Joppa</i> and <i>Jerusalem</i>,
  where he was honourably received; from thence he went in like manner with
  his little army to the cities of <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, to establish
  himself against <i>Egypt</i>, by courting the people, and distributing
  extraordinary favours amongst them. All which is thus represented by
  <i>Daniel</i>. <a name="NtpDanXII_7"
  href="#NtDanXII_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> <i>And in his</i>
  [<i>Philometor</i>'s] <i>estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom
  they</i> [the <i>Syrians</i> who set up <i>Heliodorus</i>] <i>shall not
  give the honour of the kingdom. Yet he shall come in peaceably, and
  obtain the kingdom by flatteries</i> [made principally to the King of
  <i>Pergamus</i>;] <i>and the arms</i> [which in favour of
  <i>Heliodorus</i> oppose him] <i>shall be overflowed with a food from
  before him, and be broken; yea also</i> [<i>Onias</i> the high-Priest]
  <i>the Prince of the covenant. And after the league made with him,</i>
  [the King of <i>Egypt</i>, by sending <i>Apollonius</i> to his
  coronation] <i>he shall work deceitfully</i> [against the King of
  <i>Egypt</i>,] <i>for he shall come up and shall become strong</i> [in
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia </i>] <i>with a small people. And he shall enter into
  the quiet and plentiful cities of the Province</i> [of
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>;] <i>and</i> [to ingratiate himself with the
  <i>Jews</i> of <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and <i>Egypt</i>, and with their
  friends] <i>he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his
  fathers fathers: he shall scatter among them the prey and the spoil, and
  the riches</i> [exacted from other places;] <i>and shall forecast his
  devices against the strong holds</i> [of <i>Egypt</i>] <i>even for a
  time.</i></p>

  <p>These things were done in the first year of his reign, <i>An.
  Nabonass.</i> 573. And thenceforward he forecast his devices against the
  strong holds of <i>Egypt</i>, until the sixth year. For three years
  after, that is in the fourth year of his reign, <i>Menelaus</i> bought
  the high-Priesthood from <i>Jason</i>, but not paying the price was sent
  for by the King; and the King, before he could hear the cause, went into
  <i>Cilicia</i> to appease a sedition there, and left <i>Andronicus</i>
  his deputy at <i>Antioch</i>; in the mean time the brother of
  <i>Menelaus</i>, to make up the money, conveyed several vessels out of
  the Temple, selling some of them at <i>Tyre</i>, and sending others to
  <i>Andronicus</i>. When <i>Menelaus</i> was reproved for this by
  <i>Onias</i>, he caused <i>Onias</i> to be slain by <i>Andronicus</i>:
  for which fact the King at his return from <i>Cilicia</i> caused
  <i>Andronicus</i> to be put to death. Then <i>Antiochus</i> prepared his
  second expedition against <i>Egypt</i>, which he performed in the sixth
  year of his reign, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 578: for upon the death of
  <i>Cleopatra</i>, the governors of her son the young King of <i>Egypt</i>
  claimed <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> and <i>C&#339;losyria</i> from him as her
  dowry; and to recover those countries raised a great army.
  <i>Antiochus</i> considering that his father had not quitted the
  possession of those countries<a name="NtpDanXII_8"
  href="#NtDanXII_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, denied they were her dowry; and
  with another great army met and fought the <i>Egyptians</i> on the
  borders of <i>Egypt</i>, between <i>Pelusium</i> and the mountain
  <i>Casius</i>. He there beat them, and might have destroyed their whole
  army, but that he rode up and down, commanding his soldiers not to kill
  them, but to take them alive: by which humanity he gained
  <i>Pelusium</i>, and soon after all <i>Egypt</i>; entring it with a vast
  multitude of foot and chariots, elephants and horsemen, and a great navy.
  Then seizing the cities of <i>Egypt</i> as a friend, he marched to
  <i>Memphis</i>, laid the whole blame of the war upon <i>Eulæus</i> the
  King's governor, entred into outward friendship with the young King, and
  took upon him to order the affairs of the kingdom. While <i>Aniochus</i>
  was thus employ'd, a report being spread in <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i> that he
  was dead, <i>Jason</i> to recover the high-Priesthood assaulted
  <i>Jerusalem</i> with above a thousand men, and took the city: hereupon
  the King thinking <i>Judea</i> had revolted, came out of <i>Egypt</i> in
  a furious manner, re-took the city, slew forty thousand of the people,
  made as many prisoners, and sold them to raise money; went into the
  Temple, spoiled it of its treasures, ornaments, utensils, and vessels of
  gold and silver, amounting to 1800 talents; and carried all away to
  <i>Antioch</i>. This was done in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 578, and
  is thus described by <i>Daniel</i>. <a name="NtpDanXII_9"
  href="#NtDanXII_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> <i>And he shall stir up his power,
  and his courage against the King of the </i>South<i> with a great army;
  and the King of the </i>South<i> shall be stirrd up to battle with a very
  great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they</i>, even
  <i>Antiochus</i> and his friends, <i>shall forecast devices against
  him</i>, as is represented above; <i>yea, they that feed of the portion
  of his meat, shall</i> betray and <i>destroy him, and his army shall be
  overthrown, and many shall fall down slain. And both these Kings hearts
  shall be to do mischief; and they</i>, being now made friends, <i>shall
  speak lyes at one table</i>, against the <i>Jews</i> and against the holy
  covenant; <i>but it shall not prosper: for yet the end</i>, in which the
  setting up of the abomination of desolation is to prosper, <i>shall be at
  the time appointed. Then shall he return into his land with great riches,
  and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall act</i>,
  against it by spoiling the Temple, <i>and return into his own
  land</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Egyptians</i> of <i>Alexandria</i> seeing <i>Philometor</i>
  first educated in luxury by the Eunuch <i>Eulæus</i>, and now in the
  hands of <i>Antiochus</i>, gave the kingdom to <i>Euergetes</i>, the
  younger brother of <i>Philometor</i>. Whereupon <i>Antiochus</i>
  pretending to restore <i>Philometor</i>, made war upon <i>Euergetes</i>;
  beat him at sea, and besieged him and his sister <i>Cleopatra</i> in
  <i>Alexandria</i>: while the besieged Princes sent to <i>Rome</i> to
  implore the assistance of the Senate. <i>Antiochus</i> finding himself
  unable to take the city that year, returned into <i>Syria</i>, leaving
  <i>Philometor</i> at <i>Memphis</i> to govern <i>Egypt</i> in his
  absence. But <i>Philometor</i> made friendship with his brother that
  winter; and <i>Antiochus</i>, returning the next spring <i>An.
  Nabonass.</i> 580, to besiege both the brothers in <i>Alexandria</i>, was
  met in the way by the <i>Roman</i> Ambassadors, <i>Popilius Læna</i>,
  <i>C. Decimius</i>, and <i>C. Hostilius</i>: he offered them his hand to
  kiss, but <i>Popilius</i> delivering to him the tables wherein the
  message of the Senate was written, bad him read those first. When he had
  read them, he replied he would consider with his friends what was fit to
  be done; but <i>Popilius</i> drawing a circle about him, bad him answer
  before he went out of it: <i>Antiochus</i>, astonished at this blunt and
  unusual imperiousness, made answer he would do what the <i>Romans</i>
  demanded; and then <i>Popilius</i> gave the King his hand to kiss, and he
  returned out of <i>Egypt</i>. The same year, <i>An. Nabonass.</i> 580,
  his captains by his order spoiled and slaughtered the <i>Jews</i>,
  profaned the Temple, set up the worship of the heathen Gods in all
  <i>Judea</i>, and began to persecute and make war upon those who would
  not worship them: which actions are thus described by <i>Daniel</i>. <a
  name="NtpDanXII_10" href="#NtDanXII_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> <i>At the
  time appointed he shall come</i> again <i>towards the </i>South<i>, but
  the latter shall not be as the former. For the ships of </i>Chittim<i>
  shall come</i>, with an embassy from <i>Rome</i>, <i>against him.
  Therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against
  the holy covenant. So shall he do; he shall even return, and have
  intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</i></p>

  <p>In the same year that <i>Antiochus</i> by the command of the
  <i>Romans</i> retired out of <i>Egypt</i>, and set up the worship of the
  <i>Greeks</i> in <i>Judea</i>; the <i>Romans</i> conquered the kingdom of
  <i>Macedon</i>, the fundamental kingdom of the Empire of the
  <i>Greeks</i>, and reduced it into a <i>Roman</i> Province; and thereby
  began to put an end to the reign of <i>Daniel</i>'s third Beast. This is
  thus exprest by <i>Daniel</i>. <i>And after him Arms</i>, that is the
  <i>Romans</i>, <i>shall stand up</i>. As <span lang="he" title="MMLK"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5DE;&#x5DC;&#x5DA;</bdo></span> signifies
  <i>after the King</i>, Dan. xi. 8; so <span lang="he" title="MMNW" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5DE;&#x5E0;&#x5D5;</bdo></span> may signify <i>after
  him</i>. <i>Arms</i> are every where in this Prophecy of <i>Daniel</i>
  put for the military power of a kingdom: and they stand up when they
  conquer and grow powerful. Hitherto <i>Daniel</i> described the actions
  of the Kings of the <i>North</i> and <i>South</i>; but upon the conquest
  of <i>Macedon</i> by the <i>Romans</i>, he left off describing the
  actions of the <i>Greeks</i>, and began to describe those of the
  <i>Romans</i> in <i>Greece</i>. They conquered <i>Macedon</i>,
  <i>Illyricum</i> and <i>Epirus</i>, in the year of <i>Nabonassar</i> 580.
  35 years after, by the last will and testament of <i>Attalus</i> the last
  King of <i>Pergamus</i>, they inherited that rich and flourishing
  kingdom, that is, all <i>Asia</i> westward of mount <i>Taurus</i>; 69
  years after they conquered the kingdom of <i>Syria</i>, and reduced it
  into a Province, and 34 years after they did the like to <i>Egypt</i>. By
  all these steps the <i>Roman</i> Arms stood up over the <i>Greeks</i>:
  and after 95 years more, by making war upon the <i>Jews</i>, <i>they
  polluted the sanctuary of strength, and took away the daily sacrifice,
  and then placed the abomination of desolation</i>. For this abomination
  was placed after the days of <i>Christ</i>, <i>Math.</i> xxiv. 15. In the
  16th year of the Emperor <i>Adrian</i>, A.C. 132, they placed this
  abomination by building a Temple to <i>Jupiter Capitolinus</i>, where the
  Temple of God in <i>Jerusalem</i> had stood. Thereupon the <i>Jews</i>
  under the conduct of <i>Barchochab</i> rose up in arms against the
  <i>Romans</i>, and in the war had 50 cities demolished, 985 of their best
  towns destroyed, and 580000 men slain by the sword; and in the end of the
  war, A.C. 136, were banished <i>Judea</i> upon pain of death, and
  thenceforward the land remained desolate of its old inhabitants.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the <i>Jewish</i> war in <i>Nero</i>'s reign, the
  Apostles fled out of <i>Judea</i> with their flocks; some beyond
  <i>Jordan</i> to <i>Pella</i> and other places, some into <i>Egypt</i>,
  <i>Syria</i>, <i>Mesopotamia</i>, <i>Asia minor</i>, and elsewhere.
  <i>Peter</i> and <i>John</i> came into <i>Asia</i>, and <i>Peter</i> went
  thence by <i>Corinth</i> to <i>Rome</i>; but <i>John</i> staying in
  <i>Asia</i>, was banished by the <i>Romans</i> into <i>Patmos</i>, as the
  head of a party of the <i>Jews</i>, whose nation was in war with the
  <i>Romans</i>. By this dispersion of the <i>Christian Jews</i>, the
  <i>Christian</i> religion, which was already propagated westward as far
  as <i>Rome</i>, spred fast into all the <i>Roman</i> Empire, and suffered
  many persecutions under it till the days of <i>Constantine</i> the great
  and his sons: all which is thus described by <i>Daniel</i>. <a
  name="NtpDanXII_11" href="#NtDanXII_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> <i>And such
  as do wickedly against the covenant, shall he</i>, who places the
  abomination, <i>cause to dissemble</i>, and worship the heathen Gods;
  <i>but the people</i> among them <i>who do know their God, shall be
  strong and act. And they that understand among the people, shall instruct
  many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity,
  and by spoil many days. Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen
  with a little help, viz.</i> in the reign of <i>Constantine</i> the
  great; <i>and</i> at that time by reason of their prosperity, <i>many
  shall</i> come over to them from among the heathen, and <i>cleave to them
  with dissimulation. But of those of understanding there shall</i> still
  <i>fall to try</i> God's people <i>by them and to purge</i> them from the
  dissemblers, <i>and to make them white even to the time of the end:
  because it is yet for a time appointed.</i></p>

  <p>Hitherto the <i>Roman</i> Empire continued entire; and under this
  dominion, the little horn of the He-Goat continued <i>mighty, but not by
  his own power</i>. But now, by the building of <i>Constantinople</i>, and
  endowing it with a Senate and other like privileges with <i>Rome</i>; and
  by the division of the <i>Roman</i> Empire into the two Empires of the
  <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Latins</i>, headed by those two cities; a new scene
  of things commences, in which which <a name="NtpDanXII_12"
  href="#NtDanXII_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> <i>a King</i>, the Empire of the
  <i>Greeks</i>, <i>doth according to his will, and</i>, by setting his own
  laws above the laws of God, <i>exalts and magnifies himself above every
  God, and speaks marvellous things against the God of Gods, and shall
  prosper till the indignation be accomplished.&mdash;Neither shall he
  regard the God of his fathers, nor the</i> lawful <i>desire of women</i>
  in matrimony, <i>nor any God, but shall magnify himself above all. And in
  his seat he shall honour </i>Mahuzzims, that is, strong guardians, the
  souls of the dead; <i>even with a God whom his fathers knew not shall he
  honour them</i>, in their Temples, <i>with gold and silver, and with
  precious stones and valuable things</i>. All which relates to the
  overspreading of the <i>Greek</i> Empire with Monks and Nuns, who placed
  holiness in abstinence from marriage; and to the invocation of saints and
  veneration of their reliques, and such like superstitions, which these
  men introduced in the fourth and fifth centuries. <a name="NtpDanXII_13"
  href="#NtDanXII_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> <i>And at the time of the end the
  King of the</i> South, or the Empire of the <i>Saracens</i>, <i>shall
  push at him</i>; <i>and the King of the</i> North, or Empire of the
  <i>Turks</i>, <i>shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots
  and with horsemen, and with many ships</i>; <i>and be shall enter into
  the countries</i> of the <i>Greeks</i>, <i>and shall overflow and pass
  over. He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
  shall be overthrown; but these shall escape out of his hand, even
  </i>Edom<i> and </i>Moab<i>, and the chief of the children</i> Ammon:
  that is, those to whom his Caravans pay tribute. <i>He shall stretch
  forth his hand also upon the countries, and the land of </i>Egypt<i>
  shall not escape</i>; <i>but he shall have power over the treasures of
  gold and silver, and over all the precious things of </i>Egypt<i>; and
  the </i>Lybians<i> and </i>Ethiopians<i> shall be at his steps</i>. All
  these nations compose the Empire of the <i>Turks</i>, and therefore this
  Empire is here to be understood by the King of the <i>North</i>. They
  compose also the body of the He-Goat; and therefore the Goat still reigns
  in his last horn, but not by his own power.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the King who did according to his
will, and magnified himself above
every God, and honoured </i>Mahuzzims<i>,
and regarded not the desire of women</i>.</p>

  <p>In the first ages of the Christian religion the Christians of every
  city were governed by a Council of Presbyters, and the President of the
  Council was the Bishop of the city. The Bishop and Presbyters of one city
  meddled not with the affairs of another city, except by admonitory
  letters or messages. Nor did the Bishops of several cities meet together
  in Council before the time of the Emperor <i>Commodus</i>: for they could
  not meet together without the leave of the <i>Roman</i> governors of the
  Provinces. But in the days of that Emperor they began to meet in
  Provincial Councils, by the leave of the governors; first in <i>Asia</i>,
  in opposition to the <i>Cataphrygian</i> Heresy, and soon after in other
  places and upon other occasions. The Bishop of the chief city, or
  Metropolis of the <i>Roman</i> Province, was usually made President of
  the Council; and hence came the authority of Metropolitan Bishops above
  that of other Bishops within the same Province. Hence also it was that
  the Bishop of <i>Rome</i> in <i>Cyprian</i>'s days called himself the
  Bishop of Bishops. As soon as the Empire became Christian, the
  <i>Roman</i> Emperors began to call general Councils out of all the
  Provinces of the Empire; and by prescribing to them what points they
  should consider, and influencing them by their interest and power, they
  set up what party they pleased. Hereby the <i>Greek</i> Empire, upon the
  division of the <i>Roman</i> Empire into the <i>Greek</i> and
  <i>Latin</i> Empires, became <i>the King who</i>, in matters of religion,
  <i>did according to his will</i>; <i>and</i>, in legislature, <i>exalted
  and magnified himself above every God</i>: and at length, by the seventh
  general Council, established the worship of the images and souls of dead
  men, here called <i>Mahuzzims</i>.</p>

  <p>The same King placed holiness in abstinence from marriage.
  <i>Eusebius</i> in his Ecclesiastical history <a name="NtpDanXIII_1"
  href="#NtDanXIII_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> tells us, that <i>Musanus</i>
  wrote a tract against those who fell away to the heresy of the
  <i>Encratites</i>, which was then newly risen, and had introduced
  pernicious errors; and that <i>Tatian</i>, the disciple of <i>Justin</i>,
  was the author thereof; and that <i>Irenæus</i> in his first book against
  heresies teaches this, writing of <i>Tatian</i> and his heresy in these
  words: <i>A Saturnino &amp; Marcione profecti qui vocantur Continentes,
  docuerunt non contrahendum esse matrimonium; reprobantes scilicet
  primitivum illud opificium Dei, &amp; tacitè accusantes Deum qui masculum
  &amp; fæminam condidit ad procreationem generis humani. Induxerunt etiam
  abstinentiam ab esu eorum quæ animalia appellant, ingratos se exhibentes
  ergo eum qui universa creavit Deum. Negant etiam primi hominis salutem.
  Atque hoc nuper apud illos excogitatum est, Tatiano quodam omnium primo
  hujus impietatis auctore: qui Justini auditor, quamdiu cum illo versatus
  est, nihil ejusmodi protulit. Post martyrium autem illius, ab Ecclesia se
  abrumpens, doctoris arrogantia elatus ac tumidus, tanquam præstantior
  cæteris, novam quandam formam doctrinæ conflavit: Æonas invisibiles
  commentus perinde ac Valentinus: asserens quoque cum Saturnino &amp;
  Marcione, matrimonium nihil aliud esse quam corruptionem ac stuprum: nova
  præterea argumenta ad subvertendam Adami salutem excogitans. Hæc Irenæus
  de Hæresi quæ tunc viguit Encratitarum.</i> Thus far <i>Eusebius</i>. But
  altho the followers of <i>Tatian</i> were at first condemned as hereticks
  by the name of <i>Encratites</i>, or <i>Continentes</i>; their principles
  could not be yet quite exploded: for <i>Montanus</i> refined upon them,
  and made only second marriages unlawful; he also introduced frequent
  fastings, and annual, fasting days, the keeping of <i>Lent</i>, and
  feeding upon dried meats. The <i>Apostolici</i>, about the middle of the
  third century, condemned marriage, and were a branch of the disciples of
  <i>Tatian</i>. The <i>Hierocitæ</i> in <i>Egypt</i>, in the latter end of
  the third century, also condemned marriage. <i>Paul</i> the
  <i>Eremite</i> fled into the wilderness from the persecution of
  <i>Decius</i>, and lived there a solitary life till the reign of
  <i>Constantine</i> the great, but made no disciples. <i>Antony</i> did
  the like in the persecution of <i>Dioclesian</i>, or a little before, and
  made disciples; and many others soon followed his example.</p>

  <p>Hitherto the principles of the <i>Encratites</i> had been rejected by
  the Churches; but now being refined by the Monks, and imposed not upon
  all men, but only upon those who would voluntarily undertake a monastic
  life, they began to be admired, and to overflow first the <i>Greek</i>
  Church, and then the <i>Latin</i> also, like a torrent. <i>Eusebius</i>
  tells us, <a name="NtpDanXIII_2" href="#NtDanXIII_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
  that <i>Constantine</i> the great had those men in the highest
  veneration, who dedicated themselves wholly to the divine philosophy; and
  that he almost venerated the most holy company of Virgins perpetually
  devoted to God; being certain that the God to whom he had consecrated
  himself did dwell in their minds. In his time and that of his sons, this
  profession of a single life was propagated in <i>Egypt</i> by
  <i>Antony</i>, and in <i>Syria</i> by <i>Hilarion</i>; and spred so fast,
  that soon after the time of <i>Julian</i> the Apostate a third part of
  the <i>Egyptians</i> were got into the desarts of <i>Egypt</i>. They
  lived first singly in cells, then associated into <i>c&#339;nobia</i> or
  convents; and at length came into towns, and filled the Churches with
  Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons. <i>Athanasius</i> in his younger days
  poured water upon the hands of his master <i>Antony</i>; and finding the
  Monks faithful to him, made many of them Bishops and Presbyters in
  <i>Egypt</i>: and these Bishops erected new Monasteries, out of which
  they chose Presbyters of their own cities, and sent Bishops to others.
  The like was done in <i>Syria</i>, the superstition being quickly
  propagated thither out of <i>Egypt</i> by <i>Hilarion</i> a disciple of
  <i>Antony</i>. <i>Spiridion</i> and <i>Epiphanius</i> of <i>Cyprus</i>,
  <i>James</i> of <i>Nisibis</i>, <i>Cyril</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
  <i>Eustathius</i> of <i>Sebastia</i> in <i>Armenia</i>, <i>Eusebius</i>
  of <i>Emisa</i>, <i>Titus</i> of <i>Bostra</i>, <i>Basilius</i> of
  <i>Ancyra</i>, <i>Acacius</i> of <i>Cæsarea</i> in <i>Palestine</i>,
  <i>Elpidius</i> of <i>Laodicea</i>, <i>Melitius</i> and <i>Flavian</i> of
  <i>Antioch</i>, <i>Theodorus</i> of <i>Tyre</i>, <i>Protogenes</i> of
  <i>Carrhæ</i>, <i>Acacius</i> of <i>Berrhæa</i>, <i>Theodotus</i> of
  <i>Hierapolis</i>, <i>Eusebius</i> of <i>Chalcedon</i>,
  <i>Amphilochius</i> of <i>Iconium</i>, <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>,
  <i>Gregory Nyssen</i>, and <i>John Chrysostom</i> of
  <i>Constantinople</i>, were both Bishops and Monks in the fourth century.
  <i>Eustathius</i>, <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i>, <i>Gregory Nyssen</i>,
  <i>Basil</i>, &amp;c. had Monasteries of Clergymen in their cities, out
  of which Bishops were sent to other cities; who in like manner erected
  Monasteries there, till the Churches were supplied with Bishops out of
  these Monasteries. Hence <i>Jerome</i>, in a Letter written about the
  year 385, <a name="NtpDanXIII_3" href="#NtDanXIII_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  saith of the Clergy: <i>Quasi &amp; ipsi aliud sint quam Monachi, &amp;
  non quicquid in Monachos dicitur redundet in Clericos qui patres sunt
  Monachorum. Detrimentum pecoris pastoris ignominia est</i>. And in his
  book against <i>Vigilantius</i>: <i>Quid facient Orientis Ecclesiæ? Quæ
  aut Virgines Clericos accipiunt, aut Continentes, aut si uxores habuerint
  mariti esse desistunt</i>. Not long after even the Emperors commanded the
  Churches to chuse Clergymen out of the Monasteries by this Law.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Impp. Arcad &amp; Honor. AA. Cæsario PF. P.</i></p>

  <p><a name="NtpDanXIII_4" href="#NtDanXIII_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <i>Si
  quos forte Episcopi deesse sibi Clericos arbitrantur, ex monachorum
  numero rectius ordinabunt: non obnoxios publicis privatisque rationibus
  cum invidia teneant, sed habeant jam probatos. Dat. </i>vii.<i> Kal. Aug.
  Honorio A. </i>iv.<i> &amp; Eutychianio Coss.</i> A.C. 598. The
  <i>Greek</i> Empire being now in the hands of these <i>Encratites</i>,
  and having them in great admiration, <i>Daniel</i> makes it a
  characteristick of the King who doth according to his will, that <i>he
  should not regard the desire of Women.</i></p>

  <p>Thus the Sect of the <i>Encratites</i>, set on foot by the
  <i>Gnosticks</i>, and propagated by <i>Tatian</i> and <i>Montanus</i>
  near the end of the second century; which was condemned by the Churches
  of that and the third century, and refined upon by their followers;
  overspread the <i>Eastern</i> Churches in the fourth century, and before
  the end of it began to overspread the <i>Western</i>. Henceforward the
  Christian Churches having a form of godliness, but denying the power
  thereof, came into the hands of the <i>Encratites</i>: and the Heathens,
  who in the fourth century came over in great numbers to the Christians,
  embraced more readily this sort of Christianity, as having a greater
  affinity with their old superstitions, than that of the sincere
  Christians; who by the lamps of the seven Churches of <i>Asia</i>, and
  not by the lamps of the Monasteries, had illuminated the Church Catholic
  during the three first centuries.</p>

  <p>The <i>Cataphrygians</i> brought in also several other superstitions:
  such as were the doctrine of Ghosts, and of their punishment in
  Purgatory, with prayers and oblations for mitigating that punishment, as
  <i>Tertullian</i> teaches in his books <i>De Anima</i> and <i>De
  Monogamia</i>. They used also the sign of the cross as a charm. So
  <i>Tertullian</i> in his book <i>de Corona militis</i>: <i>Ad omnem
  progressum atque promotum, ad omnem aditum &amp; exitum, ad vestitum, ad
  calceatum, ad lavacra, ad mensas, ad lamina, ad cubilia, ad sedilia,
  quacunque nos conversatio exercet, frontem crucis signaculo terimus</i>.
  All these superstitions the Apostle refers to, where he saith: <i>Now the
  Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart from
  the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils</i>,
  the <i>Dæmons</i> and Ghosts worshipped by the heathens, <i>speaking lyes
  in hypocrisy</i>, about their apparitions, the miracles done by them,
  their reliques, and the sign of the cross, <i>having consciences seared
  with a hot iron</i>; <i>forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain
  from meats</i>, &amp;c. 1 Tim. iv. 1,2,3. From the <i>Cataphrygians</i>
  these principles and practices were propagated down to posterity. <i>For
  the mystery of iniquity</i> did <i>already work</i> in the
  <i>Apostles</i> days in the <i>Gnosticks</i>, continued to work very
  strongly in their offspring the <i>Tatianists</i> and
  <i>Cataphrygians</i>, and was to work <i>till that man of sin</i> should
  <i>be revealed</i>; <i>whose coming is after the working of Satan, with
  all power and signs, and lying wonders, and all deceivableness of
  unrighteousness</i>; coloured over with a form of <i>Christian</i>
  godliness, but without the power thereof, 2 <i>Thess</i>. ii. 7-10.</p>

  <p>For tho some stop was put to the <i>Cataphrygian</i> Christianity, by
  Provincial Councils, till the fourth century; yet the <i>Roman</i>
  Emperors then turning <i>Christians</i>, and great multitudes of heathens
  coming over in outward profession, these found the <i>Cataphrygian</i>
  Christianity more suitable to their old principles, of placing religion
  in outward forms and ceremonies, holy-days, and doctrines of Ghosts, than
  the religion of the sincere <i>Christians</i>: wherefore they readily
  sided with the <i>Cataphrygian Christians</i>, and established that
  Christianity before the end of the fourth century. By this means those of
  understanding, after they had been persecuted by the heathen Emperors in
  the three first centuries, and <i>were holpen with a little help</i>, by
  the conversion of <i>Constantine</i> the great and his sons to the
  <i>Christian</i> religion, fell under new persecutions, <i>to purge
  them</i> from the dissemblers, <i>and to make them white, even to the
  time of the end</i>.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the </i>Mahuzzims<i>, honoured by the
King who doth according to his will</i>.</p>

  <p>In scripture we are told of some <i>trusting in God</i> and others
  <i>trusting in idols</i>, and that <i>God is our refuge, our strength,
  our defense</i>. In this sense God is <i>the rock of his people</i>, and
  false Gods are called <i>the rock of those that trust in them</i>, Deut.
  xxxii. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31, 37. In the same sense the Gods of <i>the
  King</i> who <i>shall do according to his will</i> are called
  <i>Mahuzzims</i>, munitions, fortresses, protectors, guardians, or
  defenders. <i>In his estate</i>, saith <a name="NtpDanXIV_1"
  href="#NtDanXIV_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <i>Daniel</i>, <i>shall he honour
  </i>Mahuzzims<i>; even with a God whom his fathers knew not, shall he
  honour them with gold and silver, and with precious stones, and things of
  value. Thus shall he do in the most strong holds</i> or
  temples;&mdash;<i>and he shall cause them to rule over many, and divide
  the land</i> among them <i>for a possession</i>. Now this came to pass by
  degrees in the following manner.</p>

  <p><i>Gregory Nyssen</i> <a name="NtpDanXIV_2"
  href="#NtDanXIV_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> tells us, that after the
  persecution of the Emperor <i>Decius</i>, <i>Gregory</i> Bishop of
  <i>Neocæsarea</i> in <i>Pontus</i>, <i>instituted among all people, as an
  addition or corollary of devotion towards God, that festival days and
  assemblies should be celebrated to them who had contended for the
  faith</i>, that is, to the <i>Martyrs</i>. And he adds this reason for
  the institution: <i>When he observed</i>, saith <i>Nyssen</i>, <i>that
  the simple and unskilful multitude, by reason of corporeal delights,
  remained in the error of idols; that the principal thing might be
  corrected among them, namely, that instead of their vain worship they
  might turn their eyes upon God; he permitted that at the memories of the
  holy Martyrs they might make merry and delight themselves, and be
  dissolved into joy</i>. The heathens were delighted with the festivals of
  their Gods, and unwilling to part with those delights; and therefore
  <i>Gregory</i>, to facilitate their conversion, instituted annual
  festivals to the <i>Saints</i> and <i>Martyrs</i>. Hence it came to pass,
  that for exploding the festivals of the heathens, the principal festivals
  of the <i>Christians</i> succeeded in their room: as the keeping of
  <i>Christmas</i> with ivy and feasting, and playing and sports, in the
  room of the <i>Bacchanalia</i> and <i>Saturnalia</i>; the celebrating of
  <i>May-day</i> with flowers, in the room of the <i>Floralia</i>; and the
  keeping of festivals to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, <i>John</i> the Baptist,
  and divers of the Apostles, in the room of the solemnities at the
  entrance of the Sun into the signs of the <i>Zodiac</i> in the old
  <i>Julian</i> Calendar. In the same persecution of <i>Decius</i>,
  <i>Cyprian</i> ordered the passions of the Martyrs in <i>Africa</i> to be
  registred, in order to celebrate their memories annually with oblations
  and sacrifices: and <i>Felix</i> Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, a little after,
  as <i>Platina</i> relates, <i>Martyrum gloria consulens, constituit at
  quotannis sacrificia eorum nomine celebrarentur</i>; "consulting the
  glory of the Martyrs, ordained that sacrifices should be celebrated
  annually in their name." By the pleasures of these festivals the
  <i>Christians</i> increased much in number, and decreased as much in
  virtue, until they were <i>purged and made white</i> by the persecution
  of <i>Dioclesian</i>. This was the first step made in the
  <i>Christian</i> religion towards the veneration of the Martyrs: and tho
  it did not yet amount to an unlawful worship; yet it disposed the
  <i>Christians</i> towards such a further veneration of the dead, as in a
  short time ended in the invocation of Saints.</p>

  <p>The next step was the affecting to pray at the sepulchres of the
  Martyrs: which practice began in <i>Dioclesian</i>'s persecution. The
  Council of <i>Eliberis</i> in <i>Spain</i>, celebrated in the third or
  fourth year of <i>Dioclesian</i>'s persecution, A.C. 305, hath these
  Canons. Can. 34. <i>Cereos per diem placuit in C&#339;meterio non
  incendi: inquietandi enim spiritus sanctorum non sunt. Qui hæc non
  observârint, arceantur ab Ecclesiæ communione.</i> Can. 35. <i>Placuit
  prohiberi ne fæminæ in C&#339;meterio pervigilent, eò quod sæpe sub
  obtentu orationis latentèr scelera committant.</i> Presently after that
  persecution, suppose about the year 314, the Council of <i>Laodicea</i>
  in <i>Phrygia</i>, which then met for restoring the lapsed discipline of
  the Church, has the following Canons. Can. 9. <i>Those of the Church are
  not allowed to go into the </i>C&#339;meteries<i> or </i>Martyries<i>, as
  they are called, of hereticks, for the sake of prayer or recovery of
  health: but such as go, if they be of the faithful, shall be
  excommunicated for a time</i>. Can. 34. <i>A </i>Christian<i> must not
  leave the Martyrs of </i>Christ<i>, and go to false Martyrs</i>, that is,
  to the Martyrs of the hereticks; <i>for these are alien from God: and
  therefore let those be anathema who go to them</i>. Can. 51. <i>The
  birth-days of the Martyrs shall not be celebrated in </i>Lent<i>, but
  their commemoration shall be made on the Sabbath-days and Lords days</i>.
  The Council of <i>Paphlagonia</i>, celebrated in the year 324, made this
  Canon: <i>If any man being arrogant, abominates the congregations of the
  Martyrs, or the Liturgies performed therein, or the memories of the
  Martyrs, let him be anathema</i>. By all which it is manifest that the
  <i>Christians</i> in the time of <i>Dioclesian</i>'s persecution used to
  pray in the <i>C&#339;meteries</i> or burying-places of the dead; for
  avoiding the danger of the persecution, and for want of Churches, which
  were all thrown down: and after the persecution was over, continued that
  practice in honour of the Martyrs, till new Churches could be built: and
  by use affected it as advantageous to devotion, and for recovering the
  health of those that were sick. It also appears that in these
  burying-places they commemorated the Martyrs yearly upon days dedicated
  to them, and accounted all these practices pious and religious, and
  anathematized those men as arrogant who opposed them, or prayed in the
  <i>Martyries</i> of the hereticks. They also lighted torches to the
  Martyrs in the day-time, as the heathens did to their Gods; which custom,
  before the end of the fourth century, prevailed much in the <i>West</i>.
  They sprinkled the worshipers of the Martyrs with holy-water, as the
  heathens did the worshipers of their Gods; and went in pilgrimage to see
  <i>Jerusalem</i> and other holy places, as if those places conferred
  sanctity on the visiters. From the custom of praying in the
  <i>C&#339;meteries</i> and <i>Martyries</i>, came the custom of
  translating the bodies of the Saints and Martyrs into such Churches as
  were new built: the Emperor <i>Constantius</i> began this practice about
  the year 359, causing the bodies of <i>Andrew</i> the Apostle,
  <i>Luke</i> and <i>Timothy</i>, to be translated into a new Church at
  <i>Constantinople</i>: and before this act of <i>Constantius</i>, the
  <i>Egyptians</i> kept the bodies of their Martyrs and Saints unburied
  upon beds in their private houses, and told stories of their souls
  appearing after death and ascending up to heaven, as <i>Athanasius</i>
  relates in the life of <i>Antony</i>. All which gave occasion to the
  Emperor <i>Julian</i>, as <i>Cyril</i> relates, to accuse the
  <i>Christians</i> in this manner: <i>Your adding to that antient dead
  man, Jesus, many new dead men, who can sufficiently abominate? You have
  filled all places with sepulchres and monuments, altho you are no where
  bidden to prostrate yourselves to sepulchres, and to respect them
  officiously.</i> And a little after: <i>Since </i>Jesus<i> said that
  sepulchres are full of filthiness, how do you invoke God upon them</i>?
  and in another place he saith, that if <i>Christians</i> had adhered to
  the precepts of the <i>Hebrews</i>, <i>they would have worshiped one God
  instead of many, and not a man, or rather not many unhappy men</i>: And
  that they <i>adored the wood of the cross, making its images on their
  foreheads, and before their houses</i>.</p>

  <p>After the sepulchres of Saints and Martyrs were thus converted into
  places of worship like the heathen temples, and the Churches into
  sepulchres, and a certain sort of sanctity attributed to the dead bodies
  of the Saints and Martyrs buried in them, and annual festivals were kept
  to them, with sacrifices offered to God in their name; the next step
  towards the invocation of Saints, was the attributing to their dead
  bodies, bones and other reliques, a power of working miracles, by means
  of the separate souls, who were supposed to know what we do or say, and
  to be able to do us good or hurt, and to work those miracles. This was
  the very notion the heathens had of the separate souls of their antient
  Kings and Heroes, whom they worshiped under the names of <i>Saturn</i>,
  <i>Rhea</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Juno</i>, <i>Mars</i>, <i>Venus</i>,
  <i>Bacchus</i>, <i>Ceres</i>, <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, <i>Apollo</i>,
  <i>Diana</i>, and the rest of their Gods. For these Gods being male and
  female, husband and wife, son and daughter, brother and sister, are
  thereby discovered to be antient men and women. Now as the first step
  towards the invocation of Saints was set on foot by the persecution of
  <i>Decius</i>, and the second by the persecution of <i>Dioclesian</i>; so
  this third seems to have been owing to the proceedings of
  <i>Constantius</i> and <i>Julian</i> the Apostate. When <i>Julian</i>
  began to restore the worship of the heathen Gods, and to vilify the
  Saints and Martyrs; the <i>Christians</i> of <i>Syria</i> and
  <i>Egypt</i> seem to have made a great noise about the miracles done by
  the reliques of the <i>Christian</i> Saints and Martyrs, in opposition to
  the powers attributed by <i>Julian</i> and the heathens to their Idols.
  For <i>Sozomen</i> and <i>Ruffinus</i> tell us, that when he opened the
  heathen Temples, and consulted the Oracle of <i>Apollo Daphnæus</i> in
  the suburbs of <i>Antioch</i>, and pressed by many sacrifices for an
  answer; the Oracle at length told him that the bones of the Martyr
  <i>Babylas</i> which were buried there hinder'd him from speaking. By
  which answer we may understand, that some <i>Christian</i> was got into
  the place where the heathen Priests used to speak thro' a pipe in
  delivering their Oracles: and before this, <i>Hilary</i> in his book
  against <i>Constantius</i>, written in the last year of that Emperor,
  makes the following mention of what was then doing in the <i>East</i>
  where he was. <i>Sine martyrio persequeris. Plus crudelitati vestræ
  </i>Nero<i>, </i>Deci<i>, </i>Maximiane<i>, debemus. Diabolum enim per
  vos vicimus. Sanctus ubique beatorum martyrum sanguis exceptus est, dum
  in his Dæmones mugiunt, dum ægritudines depelluntur, dum miraculorum
  opera cernuntur, elevari sine laqueis corpora, &amp; dispensis pede
  fæminis vestes non defluere in faciem, uri sine ignibus spiritus,
  confiteri sine interrogantis incremento fidei</i>. And <i>Gregory
  Nazianzen</i>, in his first Oration against the Emperor <i>Julian</i>
  then reigning, writes thus: <i>Martyres non extimuisti quibus præclari
  honores &amp; festa constituta, à quibus Dæmones propelluntur &amp; morbi
  curantur; quorum sunt apparitiones &amp; prædictiones; quorum vel sola
  corpora idem possunt quod animæ sanctæ, sive manibus contrectentur, sive
  honorentur: quorum vel solæ sanguinis guttæ atque exigua passionis signa
  idem possunt quod corpora. Hæc non colis sed contemnis &amp;
  aspernaris</i>. These things made the heathens in the reign of the same
  Emperor demolish the sepulchre of <i>John</i> the Baptist in
  <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>, and burn his bones; when several <i>Christians</i>
  mixing themselves with the heathens, gathered up some of his remains,
  which were sent to <i>Athanasius</i>, who hid them in the wall of a
  Church; foreseeing by a prophetic spirit, as <i>Ruffinus</i> tells us,
  that they might be profitable to future generations.</p>

  <p>The cry of these miracles being once set on foot, continued for many
  years, and encreased and grew more general. <i>Chrysostom</i>, in his
  second Oration on St. <i>Babylas</i>, twenty years after the silencing of
  the Oracle of <i>Apollo Daphnæus</i> as above, <i>viz.</i> A.C. 382,
  saith of the miracles done by the Saints and their reliques <a
  name="NtpDanXIV_3" href="#NtDanXIV_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>: <i>Nulla est
  nostri hujus Orbis seu regio, seu gens, seu urbs, ubi nova &amp;
  inopinata miracula hæc non decantentur; quæ quidem si figmenta fuissent,
  prorsus in tantam hominum admirationem non venissent</i>. And a little
  after: <i>Abunde orationi nostræ fidem faciunt quæ quotidiana à
  martyribus miracula eduntur, magna affatim ad illa hominum multitudine
  affluente</i>. And in his 66th Homily, describing how the Devils were
  tormented and cast out by the bones of the Martyrs, he adds: <i>Ob eam
  causam multi plerumque Reges peregrè profecti sunt, ut hoc spectaculo
  fruerentur. Siquidem sanctorum martyrum templa futuri judicii vestigia
  &amp; signa exhibent, dum nimirum Dæmones flagris cæduntur, hominesque
  torquentur &amp; liberantur. Vide quæ sanctorum vitâ functorum vis
  sit?</i> And <i>Jerom</i> in his Epitaph on <i>Paula</i>, thus <a
  name="NtpDanXIV_4" href="#NtDanXIV_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> mentions the
  same things. <i>Paula vidit Samariam: ibi siti sunt Elisæus &amp; Abdias
  prophetæ, &amp; Joannes Baptista, ubi multis intremuit consternata
  miraculis. Nam cernebat variis dæmones rugire cruciatibus, &amp; ante
  sepulchra sanctorum ululare, homines more luporum vocibus latrare canum,
  fremere leonum, sibilare serpentum, mugire taurorum, alios rotare caput
  &amp; post tergum terram vertice tangere, suspensisque pede fæminis
  vestes non defluere in faciem</i>. This was about the year 384: and
  <i>Chrysostom</i> in his Oration on the <i>Egyptian</i> Martyrs, seems to
  make <i>Egypt</i> the ringleader in these matters, saying <a
  name="NtpDanXIV_5" href="#NtDanXIV_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>: <i>Benedictus
  Deus quandoquidem ex Ægypto prodeunt martyres, ex Ægypto illa cum Deo
  pugnante ac insanissima, &amp; unde impia ora, unde linguæ blasphemæ; ex
  Ægypto martyres habentur; non in Ægypto tantum, nec in finitima vicinaque
  regione, sed </i>UBIQUE TERRARUM<i>. Et quemadmodum in annonæ summa
  ubertate, cum viderunt urbium incolæ majorem quam usus habitatorum
  postulat esse proventum, ad peregrinas etiam urbes transmittunt: cum
  &amp; suam comitatem &amp; liberalitatem ostendant, tum ut præter horum
  abundantiam cum facilitate res quibus indigent rursus ab illis sibi
  comparent: sic &amp; Ægyptii, quod attinet ad religionis athletas,
  fecerunt. Cum apud se multam eorum Dei benignitate copiam cernerent,
  nequaquam ingens Dei munus sua civitate concluserunt, sed in </i>OMNES
  TERRÆ PARTES<i> bonorum thesauros effuderunt: cum ut suum in fratres
  amorem ostenderent, tum ut communem omnium dominum honore afficerent, ac
  civitati suæ gloriam apud omnes compararent, totiusque terrarum
  </i>ORBIS<i> esse </i>METROPOLIN<i> declararent.&mdash;Sanctorum enim
  illorum corpora quovis adamantino &amp; inexpugnabili muro tutiùs nobis
  urbem communiunt, &amp; tanquam excelsi quidam scopuli undique
  prominentes, non horum qui sub sensus cadunt &amp; oculis cernuntur
  hostium impetus propulsant tantùm, sed etiam invisibilium dæmonum
  insidias, omnesque diaboli fraudes subvertunt ac dissipant.&mdash;Neque
  vero tantùm adversus hominum insidias aut adversus fallacias dæmonum
  utilis nobis est hæc possessio, sed si nobis communis dominus ob
  peccatorum multitudinem irascatur, his objectis corporibus continuo
  poterimus eum propitium reddere civitati</i>. This Oration was written at
  <i>Antioch</i>, while <i>Alexandria</i> was yet the Metropolis of the
  <i>East</i>, that is, before the year 381, in which <i>Constantinople</i>
  became the Metropolis: and it was a work of some years for the
  <i>Egyptians</i> to have distributed the miracle-working reliques of
  their Martyrs over all the world, as they had done before that year.
  <i>Egypt</i> abounded most with the reliques of Saints and Martyrs, the
  <i>Egyptians</i> keeping them embalmed upon beds even in their private
  houses; and <i>Alexandria</i> was eminent above all other cities for
  dispersing them, so as on that account to acquire glory with all men, and
  manifest herself to be the <i>Metropolis</i> of the world. <i>Antioch</i>
  followed the example of <i>Egypt</i>, in dispersing the reliques of the
  forty Martyrs: and the examples of <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Syria</i> were
  soon followed by the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>The reliques of the forty Martyrs at <i>Antioch</i> were distributed
  among the Churches before the year 373; for <i>Athanasius</i> who died in
  that year, wrote an Oration upon them. This Oration is not yet published,
  but <i>Gerard Vossius</i> saw it in MS. in the Library of Cardinal
  <i>Ascanius</i> in <i>Italy</i>, as he says in his commentary upon the
  Oration of <i>Ephræm Syrus</i> on the same forty Martyrs. Now since the
  Monks of <i>Alexandria</i> sent the reliques of the Martyrs of
  <i>Egypt</i> into all parts of the earth, and thereby acquired glory to
  their city, and declared her in these matters the Metropolis of the whole
  world, as we have observed out of <i>Chrysostom</i>; it may be concluded,
  that before <i>Alexandria</i> received the forty Martyrs from
  <i>Antioch</i>, she began to send out the reliques of her own Martyrs
  into all parts, setting the first example to other cities. This practice
  therefore began in <i>Egypt</i> some years before the death of
  <i>Athanasius</i>. It began when the miracle-working bones of <i>John</i>
  the Baptist were carried into <i>Egypt</i>, and hid in the wall of a
  Church, <i>that they might be profitable to future generations</i>. It
  was restrained in the reign of <i>Julian</i> the Apostate: and then it
  spred from <i>Egypt</i> into all the Empire, <i>Alexandria</i> being the
  Metropolis of the whole world, according to <i>Chrysostom</i>, for
  propagating this sort of devotion, and <i>Antioch</i> and other cities
  soon following her example.</p>

  <p>In propagating these superstitions, the ring-leaders were the Monks,
  and <i>Antony</i> was at the head of them: for in the end of the life of
  <i>Antony</i>, <i>Athanasius</i> relates that these were his dying words
  to his disciples who then attended him. <i>Do you take care</i>, said
  <i>Antony</i>, <i>to adhere to </i>Christ<i> in the first place, and then
  to the Saints, that after death they may receive you as friends and
  acquaintance into the everlasting tabernacles, Think upon these things,
  perceive these things; and if you have any regard to me, remember me as a
  father</i>. This being delivered in charge to the Monks by <i>Antony</i>
  at his death, A.C. 356, could not but inflame their whole body with
  devotion towards the Saints, as the ready way to be received, by them
  into the eternal Tabernacles after death. Hence came that noise about the
  miracles, done by the reliques of the Saints in the time of
  <i>Constantius</i>: hence came the dispersion of the miracle-working
  reliques into all the Empire; <i>Alexandria</i> setting the example, and
  being renowned, for it above all other cities. Hence it came to pass in
  the days of <i>Julian</i>, A.C. 362, that <i>Athanasius</i> by a
  prophetic spirit, as <i>Ruffinus</i> tells us, hid the bones of
  <i>John</i> the Baptist from the Heathens, not in the ground to be
  forgotten, but in the hollow wall of a Church before proper witnesses,
  that they might <i>be profitable to future generations</i>. Hence also
  came the invocation of the Saints for doing such miracles, and for
  assisting men in their devotions, and mediating with God. For
  <i>Athanasius</i>, even from his youth, looked upon the dead Saints and
  Martyrs as mediators of our prayers: in his Epistle to
  <i>Marcellinus</i>, written in the days of <i>Constantine</i> the great,
  he saith that the words of the <i>Psalms</i> are not to be transposed or
  any wise changed, but to be recited and sung without any artifice, as
  they are written, <i>that the holy men who delivered them, knowing them
  to be their own words, may pray with us; or rather, that the Holy Ghost
  who spake in the holy men, seeing his own words with which he inspired
  them, may join</i> with them <i>in assisting us</i>.</p>

  <p>Whilst <i>Egypt</i> abounded with Monks above any other country, the
  veneration of the Saints began sooner, and spred faster there than in
  other places. <i>Palladius</i> going into <i>Egypt</i> in the year 388 to
  visit the Monasteries, and the sepulchres of <i>Apollonius</i> and other
  Martyrs of <i>Thebais</i> who had suffered under <i>Maximinus</i>, saith
  of them: <i>Iis omnibus Christiani fecerunt ædem unam, ubi nunc multæ
  virtutes peraguntur. Tanta autem fuit viri gratia, ut de iis quæ esset
  precatus statim exaudiretur, eum sic honorante servatore: quem etiam nos
  in martyrio precati vidimus, cum iis qui cum ipso fuerunt martyrio
  affecti; &amp; Deum adorantes, eorum corpora salutavimus.</i>
  <i>Eunapius</i> also, a heathen, yet a competent witness of what was done
  in his own times, relating how the soldiers delivered the temples of
  <i>Egypt</i> into the hands of the Monks, which was done in the year 389,
  rails thus in an impious manner at the Martyrs, as succeeding in the room
  of the old Gods of <i>Egypt</i>. <i>Illi ipsi, </i>milites<i>, Monachos
  Canobi quoque collocârunt, ut pro Diis qui animo cernuntur, servos &amp;
  quidem flagitiosos divinis honoribus percolerent, hominum mentibus ad
  cultum ceremoniasque obligatis. Ii namque condita &amp; salita eorum
  capita, qui ob scelerum multitudinem à judicibus extremo judicio fuerant
  affecti, pro Divis ostentabant; iis genua submittebant, eos in Deorum
  numerum receptabant, ad illorum sepulchra pulvere sordibusque
  conspurcati. Martyres igitur vocabantur, &amp; ministri quidem &amp;
  legati arbitrique precum apud Deos; cum fuerint servilia infida &amp;
  flagris pessimè subacta, quæ cicatrices scelerum ac nequitiæ vestigia
  corporibus circumferunt; ejusmodi tamen Deos fert tellus</i>. By these
  instances we may understand the invocation of Saints was now of some
  standing in <i>Egypt</i>, and that it was already generally received and
  practised there by the common people.</p>

  <p>Thus <i>Basil</i> a Monk, who was made Bishop of <i>Cæsarea</i> in the
  year 369, and died in the year 378, in his Oration on the Martyr
  <i>Mamas</i>, saith: <i>Be ye mindful of the Martyr; as many of you as
  have enjoyed him in your dreams, as many as in this place have been
  assisted by him in prayer, as many of you as upon invoking him by name
  have had him present in your works, as many as he has reduced into the
  way from wandering, as many as he has restored to health, as, many as
  have had their dead children restored by him to life, as many as have had
  their lives prolonged by him</i>: and a little after, he thus expresses
  the universality of this superstition in the regions of <i>Cappadocia</i>
  and <i>Bithynia</i>: <i>At the memory of the Martyr</i>, saith he, <i>the
  whole region is moved; at his festival the whole city is transported with
  joy. Nor do the kindred of the rich turn aside to the sepulchres of their
  ancestors, but all go to the place of devotion.</i> Again, in the end of
  the Homily he prays, that <i>God would preserve the Church, thus
  fortified with the great towers of the Martyrs</i>: and in his Oration on
  the forty Martyrs; <i>These are they</i>, saith he, <i>who obtaining our
  country, like certain towers afford us safety against our enemies.
  Neither are they shut up in one place only, but being distributed are
  sent into many regions, and adorn many countries.&mdash;You have often
  endeavoured, you have often laboured to find one who might pray for you:
  here are forty, emitting one voice of prayer.&mdash;He that is in
  affliction flies to these, he that rejoices has recourse to these: the
  first, that he may be freed from evil, the last that he may continue in
  happiness. Here a woman praying for her children is heard; she obtains a
  safe return for her husband from abroad, and health for him in his
  sickness.&mdash;O ye common keepers of mankind, the best companions of
  our cares, suffragans and coadjutors of our prayers, most powerful
  embassadors to God</i>, &amp;c. By all which it is manifest, that before
  the year 378, the Orations and Sermons upon the Saints went much beyond
  the bounds of mere oratorical flourishes, and that the common people in
  the <i>East</i> were already generally corrupted by the Monks with
  Saint-worship.</p>

  <p><i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> a Monk, in his sixth Oration written A.C.
  373, when he was newly made Bishop of <i>Sasima</i>, saith: <i>Let us
  purify ourselves to the Martyrs, or rather to the God of the Martyrs</i>:
  and a little after he calls the Martyrs <i>mediators of obtaining an
  ascension or divinity</i>. The same year, in the end of his Oration upon
  <i>Athanasius</i> then newly dead, he thus invokes him: <i>Do thou look
  down upon us propitiously, and govern this people, as perfect adorers of
  the perfect Trinity, which in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is
  contemplated and worshiped: if there shall be peace, preserve me, and
  feed my flock with me; but if war, bring me home, place me by thyself,
  and by those that are like thee; however great my request.</i> And in the
  end of the funeral Oration upon <i>Basil</i>, written A.C. 378, he thus
  addresses him: <i>But thou, O divine and sacred Head, look down upon us
  from heaven; and by thy prayers either take away that thorn of the flesh
  which is given us by God for exercise, or obtain that we may bear it with
  courage, and direct all our life to that which is most fitting for us.
  When we depart this life, receive us there in your Tabernacles, that
  living together and beholding the holy and blessed Trinity more purely
  and perfectly, whereof we have now but an imperfect view, we may there
  come to the end of our desires, and receive this reward of the wars which
  we have waged or suffered</i>: and in his Oration upon <i>Cyprian</i>,
  not the Bishop of <i>Carthage</i>, but a <i>Greek</i>, he invokes him
  after the same manner; and tells us also how a pious Virgin named
  <i>Justina</i>, was protected by invoking the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, and how
  miracles were done by the ashes of <i>Cyprian</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Gregory Nyssen</i>, another eminent Monk and Bishop, in the life of
  <i>Ephræm Syrus</i>, tells how a certain man returning from a far
  country, was in great danger, by reason all the ways were intercepted by
  the armies of barbarous nations; but upon invoking <i>Ephræm</i> by name,
  and saying, <i>Holy </i>Ephræm<i> assist me</i>, he escaped the danger,
  neglected the fear of death, and beyond his hope got safe home. In the
  end of this Oration <i>Gregory</i> calls upon <i>Ephræm</i> after the
  following manner: <i>But thou, O Ephræm, assisting now at the divine
  altar, and sacrificing to the Prince of life, and to the most holy
  Trinity, together with the Angels; remember us all, and obtain for us
  pardon of our sins, that we may enjoy the eternal happiness of the
  kingdom of heaven.</i> The same <i>Gregory</i>, in his Oration on the
  Martyr <i>Theodorus</i> written A.C. 381, thus describes the power of
  that Martyr, and the practice of the people. <i>This Martyr</i>, saith
  he, <i>the last year quieted the barbarous tempest, and put a stop to the
  horrid war of the fierce and cruel </i>Scythians<i>.&mdash;If any one is
  permitted to carry away the dust with which the tomb is covered, wherein
  the body of the Martyr rests; the dust is accepted as a gift, and
  gathered to be laid up as a thing of great price. For to touch the
  reliques themselves, if any such prosperous fortune shall at any time
  happen; how great a favour that is, and not to be obtained without the
  most earnest prayers, they know well who have obtained it. For as a
  living and florid body, they who behold it embrace it, applying to it the
  eyes, mouth, ears, and all the organs of sense; and then with affection
  pouring tears upon the Martyr, as if he was whole and appeared to them:
  they offer prayers with supplication, that he would intercede for them as
  an advocate, praying to him as an Officer attending upon God, and
  invoking him as receiving gifts whenever he will.</i> At length
  <i>Gregory</i> concludes the Oration with this prayer: <i>O Theodorus, we
  want many blessings; intercede and beseech for thy country before the
  common King and Lord: for the country of the Martyr is the place of his
  passion, and they are his citizens, brethren and kindred, who have him,
  defend, adorn and honour him. We fear afflictions, we expect dangers: the
  wicked </i>Scythians<i> are not far off, ready to make war against us. As
  a soldier fight for us, as a Martyr use liberty of speech for thy
  fellow-servants. Pray for peace, that these publick meetings may not
  cease, that the furious and wicked barbarian may not rage against the
  temples and altars, that the profane and impious may not trample upon the
  holy things. We acknowledge it a benefit received from thee, that we are
  preserved safe and entire, we pray for freedom from danger in time to
  come: and if there shall be need of greater intercession and deprecation,
  call together the choir of thy brethren the Martyrs, and in conjunction
  with them all intercede for us. Let the prayers of many just ones attone
  for the sins of the multitudes and the people; exhort </i>Peter<i>,
  excite </i>Paul<i>, and also </i>John<i> the divine and beloved disciple,
  that they may be sollicitous for the Churches which they have erected,
  for which they have been in chains, for which they have undergone dangers
  and deaths; that the worship of idols may not lift up its head against
  us, that heresies may not spring up like thorns in the vineyard, that
  tares grown up may not choak the wheat, that no rock void of the fatness
  of true dew may be against us, and render the fruitful power of the word
  void of a root; but by the power of the prayers of thyself and thy
  companions, O admirable man and eminent among the Martyrs, the
  commonwealth of </i>Christians<i> may become a field of corn</i>. The
  same <i>Gregory Nyssen</i>, in his sermon upon the death of
  <i>Meletius</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i>, preached at
  <i>Constantinople</i> the same year, A.C. 381, before the Bishops of all
  the <i>East</i> assembled in the second general Council, spake thus of
  <i>Meletius</i>. <i>The Bridegroom</i>, saith he, <i>is not taken from
  us: he stands in the midst of us, tho we do not see him: he is a Priest
  in the most inward places, and face to face intercedes before God for us
  and the sins of the people</i>. This was no oratorical flourish, but
  <i>Gregory</i>'s real opinion, as may be understood by what we have cited
  out of him concerning <i>Ephræm</i> and <i>Theodorus</i>: and as
  <i>Gregory</i> preached this before the Council of <i>Constantinople</i>,
  you may thence know, saith <a name="NtpDanXIV_6"
  href="#NtDanXIV_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> <i>Baronius</i>, that he professed
  what the whole Council, and therewith the whole Church of those parts
  believed, namely, that the Saints in heaven offer prayers for us before
  God.</p>

  <p><i>Ephræm Syrus</i>, another eminent Monk, who was contemporary with
  <i>Basil</i>, and died the same year; in the end of his Encomium or
  Oration upon <i>Basil</i> then newly dead, invokes him after this manner:
  <i>Intercede for me, a very miserable man; and recal me by thy
  intercessions, O father; thou who art strong, pray for me who am weak;
  thou who art diligent, for me who am negligent; thou who art chearful,
  for me who am heavy; thou who art wise, for me who am foolish. Thou who
  hast treasured up a treasure of all virtues, be a guide to me who am
  empty of every good work</i>. In the beginning of his Encomium upon the
  forty Martyrs, written at the same time, he thus invokes them: <i>Help me
  therefore, O ye Saints, with your intercession; and O ye beloved, with
  your holy prayers, that </i>Christ<i> by his grace may direct my tongue
  to speak</i>, &amp;c. and afterwards mentioning the mother of one of
  these forty Martyrs, he concludes the Oration with this prayer: <i>I
  entreat thee, O holy, faithful, and blessed woman, pray for me to the
  Saints, saying; Intercede ye that triumph in </i>Christ<i>, for the most
  little and miserable </i>Ephræm<i>, that he may find mercy, and by the
  grace of </i>Christ<i> may be saved</i>. Again, in his second Sermon or
  Oration on the praises of the holy Martyrs of <i>Christ</i>, he thus
  addresses them: <i>We entreat you most holy Martyrs, to intercede with
  the Lord for us miserable sinners, beset with the filthiness of
  negligence, that he would infuse his divine grace into us</i>: and
  afterwards, near the end of the same discourse; <i>Now ye most holy men
  and glorious Martyrs of God, help me a miserable sinner with your
  prayers, that in that dreadful hour I may obtain mercy, when the secrets
  of all hearts shall be made manifest. I am to day become to you, most
  holy Martyrs of </i>Christ<i>, as it were an unprofitable and unskilful
  cup-bearer: for I have delivered to the sons and brothers of your faith,
  a cup of the excellent wine of your warfare, with the excellent table of
  your victory, replenished with all sorts of dainties. I have endeavoured,
  with the whole affection and desire of my mind, to recreate your fathers
  and brothers, kindred and relations, who daily frequent the table. For
  behold they sing, and with exultation and jubilee glorify God, who has
  crown'd your virtues, by setting on your most sacred heads incorruptible
  and celestial crowns; they with excessive joy stand about the sacred
  reliques of your martyrdoms, wishing for a blessing, and desiring to bear
  away holy medicines both for the body and the mind. As good disciples and
  faithful ministers of our benign Lord and Saviour, bestow therefore a
  blessing on them all: and on me also, tho weak and feeble, who having
  received strength by your merits and intercessions, have with the whole
  devotion of my mind, sung a hymn to your praise and glory before your
  holy reliques. Wherefore I beseech you stand before the throne of the
  divine Majesty for me </i>Ephræm<i>, a vile and miserable sinner, that by
  your prayers I may deserve to obtain salvation, and with you enjoy
  eternal felicity by the grace and benignity and mercy of our Lord and
  Saviour </i>Jesus Christ<i>, to whom with the Father and Holy Ghost be
  praise, honour and glory for ever and ever</i>. Amen.</p>

  <p>By what has been cited out of <i>Basil</i>, the two <i>Gregories</i>
  and <i>Ephræm</i>, we may understand that Saint-worship was established
  among the Monks and their admirers in <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Ph&#339;nicia</i>,
  <i>Syria</i> and <i>Cappadocia</i>, before the year 378, this being the
  year in which <i>Basil</i> and <i>Ephræm</i> died. <i>Chrysostom</i> was
  not much later; he preached at <i>Antioch</i> almost all the time of
  <i>Theodosius</i> the great, and in his Sermons are many exhortations to
  this sort of superstition, as may be seen in the end of his Orations on
  S. <i>Julia</i>, on St. <i>Pelagia</i>, on the Martyr <i>Ignatius</i>, on
  the <i>Egyptian</i> Martyrs, on Fate and Providence, on the Martyrs in
  general, on St. <i>Berenice</i> and St. <i>Prosdoce</i>, on
  <i>Juventinus</i> and <i>Maximus</i>, on the name of
  <i>C&#339;metery</i>, &amp;c. Thus in his Sermon on <i>Berenice</i> and
  <i>Prosdoce</i>: <i>Perhaps</i>, saith he, <i>you are inflamed with no
  small love towards these Martyrs; therefore with this ardour let us fall
  down before their reliques, let us embrace their coffins. For the coffins
  of the Martyrs have great virtue, even as the bones of the Martyrs have
  great power. Nor let us only on the day of this festival, but also on
  other days apply to them, invoke them, and beseech them to be our
  patrons: for they have great power and efficacy, not only whilst alive,
  but also after death; and much more after death than before. For now they
  bear the marks or brands of </i>Christ<i>; and when they shew these
  marks, they can obtain all things of the King. Seeing therefore they
  abound with such efficacy, and have so much friendship with him; we also,
  when by continual attendance and perpetual visitation of them we have
  insinuated ourselves into their familiarity, may by their assistance
  obtain the mercy of God</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Constantinople</i> was free from these superstitions till
  <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> came thither A.D. 379; but in a few years it was
  also inflamed with it. <i>Ruffinus</i> <a name="NtpDanXIV_7"
  href="#NtDanXIV_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> tells us, that when the Emperor
  <i>Theodosius</i> was setting out against the tyrant <i>Eugenius</i>,
  which was in the year 394, he went about with the Priests and people to
  all the places of prayer; lay prostrate in haircloth before the shrines
  of the Martyrs and Apostles, and pray'd for assistance by the
  intercession of the Saints. <i>Sozomen</i> <a name="NtpDanXIV_8"
  href="#NtDanXIV_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> adds, that when the Emperor was
  marched seven miles from <i>Constantinople</i> against <i>Eugenius</i>,
  he went into a Church which he had built to <i>John</i> the Baptist,
  <i>and invoked the Baptist for his assistance. Chrysostom</i> <a
  name="NtpDanXIV_9" href="#NtDanXIV_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> says: <i>He that
  is clothed in purple, approaches to embrace these sepulchres; and laying
  aside his dignity, stands supplicating the Saints to intercede for him
  with God: and he who goes crowned with a diadem, offers his prayers to
  the tent-maker and the fisher-man as his Protestors.</i> And in <a
  name="NtpDanXIV_10" href="#NtDanXIV_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> another
  place: <i>The cities run together to the sepulchres of the Martyrs, and
  the people are inflamed with the love of them</i>.</p>

  <p>This practice of sending reliques from place to place for working
  miracles, and thereby inflaming the devotion of the nations towards the
  dead Saints and their reliques, and setting up the religion of invoking
  their souls, lasted only till the middle of the reign of the Emperor
  <i>Theodosius</i> the great; for he then prohibited it by the following
  Edict. <i>Humatum corpus, nemo ad alterum locum transferat; nemo Martyrem
  distrahat, nemo mercetur: Habeant verò in potestate, si quolibet in loco
  sanctorum est aliquis conditus, pro ejus veneratione, quod
  </i>Martyrium<i> vocandum sit, addant quod voluerint fabricarum. Dat.
  </i>iv.<i> Kal. Mart. Constantinopoli, Honorio nob. puero &amp; Euodio
  Coss.</i> A.C. 386. After this they filled the fields and high-ways with
  altars erected to Martyrs, which they pretended to discover by dreams and
  revelations: and this occasioned the making the fourteenth Canon of the
  fifth Council of <i>Carthage</i>, A.C. 398. <i>Item placuit, ut altaria,
  quæ passim per agros aut vias, tanquam memoriæ Martyrum constituuntur, in
  quibus nullum corpus aut reliquiæ Martyrum conditæ probantur, ab
  Episcopis, qui illis locis præsunt, si fieri potest, evertantur. Si autem
  hoc propter tumultus populares non sinitur, plebes tamen admoneantur, ne
  illa loca frequentent, ut qui rectè sapiunt, nullâ ibi superstitione
  devincti teneantur. Et omnino nulla memoria Martyrum probabiliter
  acceptetur, nisi aut ibi corpus aut aliquæ certæ reliquiæ sint, aut ubi
  origo alicujus habitationis, vel possessionis, vel passionis fidelissima
  origine traditur. Nam quæ per somnia, &amp; per inanes quasi revelationes
  quorumlibet hominum ubique constituuntur altaria, omnimodè
  reprobentur.</i> These altars were for invoking the Saints or Martyrs
  buried or pretended to be buried under them. First they filled the
  Churches in all places with the reliques or pretended reliques of the
  Martyrs, for invoking them in the Churches; and then they filled the
  fields and high-ways with altars, for invoking them every where: and this
  new religion was set up by the Monks in all the <i>Greek</i> Empire
  before the expedition of the Emperor <i>Theodosius</i> against
  <i>Eugenius</i>, and I think before his above-mentioned Edict, A.C.
  386.</p>

  <p>The same religion of worshiping <i>Mahuzzims</i> quickly spred into
  the <i>Western Empire</i> also: but <i>Daniel</i> in this Prophecy
  describes chiefly the things done among the nations comprehended in the
  body of his third Beast.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Introduction, concerning the time when
the </i>Apocalypse<i> was written</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Irenæus</i> introduced an opinion that the <i>Apocalypse</i> was
  written in the time of <i>Domitian</i>; but then he also postponed the
  writing of some others of the sacred books, and was to place the
  <i>Apocalypse</i> after them: he might perhaps have heard from his master
  <i>Polycarp</i> that he had received this book from <i>John</i> about the
  time of <i>Domitian</i>'s death; or indeed <i>John</i> might himself at
  that time have made a new publication of it, from whence <i>Irenæus</i>
  might imagine it was then but newly written. <i>Eusebius</i> in his
  <i>Chronicle</i> and <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> follows
  <i>Iren&#339;us</i>; but afterwards <a name="NtpJohI_1"
  href="#NtJohI_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in his <i>Evangelical
  Demonstrations</i>, he conjoins the banishment of <i>John</i> into
  <i>Patmos</i>, with the deaths of <i>Peter</i> and <i>Paul</i>: and so do
  <a name="NtpJohI_2" href="#NtJohI_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>Tertullian</i>
  and <i>Pseudo-Prochorus</i>, as well as the first author, whoever he was,
  of that very antient fable, that <i>John</i> was put by <i>Nero</i> into
  a vessel of hot oil, and coming out unhurt, was banished by him into
  <i>Patmos.</i> Tho this story be no more than a fiction yet was it
  founded on a tradition of the first churches, that <i>John</i> was
  banished into <i>Patmos</i> in the days of <i>Nero</i>. <i>Epiphanius</i>
  represents the <i>Gospel of John</i> as written in the time of
  <i>Domitian</i>, and the <i>Apocalypse</i> even before that of
  <i>Nero</i>. <a name="NtpJohI_3" href="#NtJohI_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  <i>Arethas</i> in the beginning of his Commentary quotes the opinion of
  <i>Irenæus</i> from <i>Eusebius</i>, but follows it not: for he
  afterwards affirms the <i>Apocalypse</i> was written before the
  destruction of <i>Jerusalem</i>, and that former commentators had
  expounded the sixth seal of that destruction.</p>

  <p>With the opinion of the first Commentators agrees the tradition of the
  Churches of <i>Syria</i>, preserved to this day in the title of the
  <i>Syriac</i> Version of the <i>Apocalypse</i>, which title is this:
  <i>The Revelation which was made to </i>John<i> the Evangelist by God in
  the Island </i>Patmos<i>, into which he was banished by </i>Nero <i>the
  </i>Cæsar. The fame is confirmed by a story told by <a name="NtpJohI_4"
  href="#NtJohI_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <i>Eusebius</i> out of <i>Clemens
  Alexandrinus</i>, and other antient authors, concerning a youth, whom
  <i>John</i> some time after his return from <i>Patmos</i> committed to
  the care of the Bishop of a certain city. The Bishop educated,
  instructed, and at length baptized him; but then remitting of his care,
  the young man thereupon got into ill company, and began by degrees first
  to revel and grow vitious, then to abuse and spoil those he met in the
  night; and at last grew so desperate, that his companions turning a band
  of high-way men, made him their Captain: and, saith <a name="NtpJohI_5"
  href="#NtJohI_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> <i>Chrysostom</i>, he continued their
  Captain a long time. At length <i>John</i> returning to that city, and
  hearing what was done, rode to the thief; and, when he out of reverence
  to his old master fled, <i>John</i> rode after him, recalled him, and
  restored him to the Church. This is a story of many years, and requires
  that <i>John</i> should have returned from <i>Patmos</i> rather at the
  death of <i>Nero</i> than at that of <i>Domitian</i>; because between the
  death of <i>Domitian</i> and that of <i>John</i> there were but two years
  and an half; and <i>John</i> in his old age was <a name="NtpJohI_6"
  href="#NtJohI_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> so infirm as to be carried to Church,
  dying above 90 years old, and therefore could not be then suppos'd able
  to ride after the thief.</p>

  <p>This opinion is further supported by the allusions in the
  <i>Apocalypse</i> to the Temple and Altar, and holy City, as then
  standing; and to the <i>Gentiles</i>, who were soon after to tread under
  foot the holy City and outward Court. 'Tis confirmed also by the style of
  the <i>Apocalypse</i> itself, which is fuller of <i>Hebraisms</i> than
  his Gospel. For thence it may be gathered, that it was written when
  <i>John</i> was newly come out of <i>Judea</i>, where he had been used to
  the <i>Syriac</i> tongue; and that he did not write his Gospel, till by
  long converse with the <i>Asiatick</i> Greeks he had left off most of the
  <i>Hebraisms</i>. It is confirmed also by the many false
  <i>Apocalypses</i>, as those of <i>Peter</i>, <i>Paul</i>, <i>Thomas</i>,
  <i>Stephen</i>, <i>Elias</i> and <i>Cerinthus</i>, written in imitation
  of the true one. For as the many false Gospels, false Acts, and false
  Epistles were occasioned by true ones; and the writing many false
  <i>Apocalypses</i>, and ascribing them to Apostles and Prophets, argues
  that there was a true Apostolic one in great request with the first
  <i>Christians</i>: so this true one may well be suppos'd to have been
  written early, that there may be room in the Apostolic age for the
  writing of so many false ones afterwards, and fathering them upon
  <i>Peter</i>, <i>Paul</i>, <i>Thomas</i> and others, who were dead before
  <i>John</i>. <i>Caius</i>, who was contemporary with <i>Tertullian</i>,
  <a name="NtpJohI_7" href="#NtJohI_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> tells us that
  <i>Cerinthus</i> wrote his Revelations as a great Apostle, and pretended
  the visions were shewn him by Angels, asserting a <i>millennium</i> of
  carnal pleasures at <i>Jerusalem</i> after the resurrection; so that his
  <i>Apocalypse</i> was plainly written in imitation of <i>John</i>'s: and
  yet he lived so early, that <a name="NtpJohI_8"
  href="#NtJohI_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> he resisted the Apostles at
  <i>Jerusalem</i> in or before the first year of <i>Claudius</i>, that is,
  26 years before the death of <i>Nero</i>, and <a name="NtpJohI_9"
  href="#NtJohI_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> died before <i>John</i>.</p>

  <p>These reasons may suffice for determining the time; and yet there is
  one more, which to considering men may seem a good reason, to others not.
  I'll propound it, and leave it to every man's judgment. The
  <i>Apocalypse</i> seems to be alluded to in the Epistles of <i>Peter</i>
  and that to the <i>Hebrews</i> and therefore to have been written before
  them. Such allusions in the Epistle to the <i>Hebrews</i>, I take to be
  the discourses concerning the High-Priest in the heavenly Tabernacle, who
  is both Priest and King, as was <i>Melchisedec</i>; and those concerning
  the <i>word of God</i>, with the <i>sharp two-edged sword</i>, the <span
  lang="el" title="sabbatismos"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3B1;&#x3B2;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  or <i>millennial</i> rest, the <i>earth whose end is to be burned</i>,
  suppose by the lake of fire, <i>the judgment and fiery indignation which
  shall devour the adversaries</i>, the <i>heavenly City which hath
  foundations whose builder and maker is God</i>, the <i>cloud of
  witnesses, mount </i>Sion<i>, heavenly </i>Jerusalem<i>, general
  assembly, spirits of just men made perfect</i>, <i>viz.</i> by the
  resurrection, and <i>the shaking of heaven and earth, and removing them,
  that the new heaven, new earth and new kingdom which cannot be shaken,
  may remain</i>. In the first of <i>Peter</i> occur these: <a
  name="NtpJohI_10" href="#NtJohI_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> <i>The Revelation
  of Jesus Christ</i>, twice or thrice repeated; <a name="NtpJohI_11"
  href="#NtJohI_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> the <i>blood of </i>Christ<i> as of

  href="#NtJohI_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> <i>the Church at </i>Babylon. These
  are indeed obscurer allusions; but the second Epistle, from the 19th
  verse of the first Chapter to the end, seems to be a continued Commentary
  upon the <i>Apocalypse</i>. There, in writing to the <i>Churches in
  </i>Asia, to whom <i>John</i> was commanded to send this Prophecy, he
  tells them, they <i>have a more sure word of Prophecy</i>, to be heeded
  by them, <i>as a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn,
  and the day-star arise in their hearts</i>, that is, until they begin to
  understand it: for <i>no Prophecy</i>, saith he, <i>of the scripture is
  of any private interpretation; the Prophecy came not in old time by the
  will of man, but holy men of God spake, as they were moved by the Holy
  Ghost. Daniel</i> <a name="NtpJohI_17"
  href="#NtJohI_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> himself professes that he
  understood not his own <i>Prophecies</i>; and therefore the Churches were
  not to expect the interpretation from their Prophet <i>John</i>, but to
  study the Prophecies themselves. This is the substance of what
  <i>Peter</i> says in the first chapter; and then in the second he
  proceeds to describe, out of this <i>sure word of Prophecy</i>, how there
  should arise in the Church <i>false Prophets</i>, or <i>false
  teachers</i>, expressed collectively in the <i>Apocalypse</i> by the name
  of the false Prophet; who should <i>bring in damnable heresies, even
  denying the Lord that bought them</i>, which is the character of
  <i>Antichrist</i>: <i>And many</i>, saith he, <i>shall follow their
  lusts</i> <a name="NtpJohI_18" href="#NtJohI_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>;
  they that dwell on the earth <a name="NtpJohI_19"
  href="#NtJohI_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> shall be deceived by the false
  Prophet, and be made drunk with the wine of the Whore's fornication,
  <i>by reason of whom the way of truth shall be blasphemed</i>; for <a
  name="NtpJohI_20" href="#NtJohI_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> the Beast is full
  of blasphemy: <i>and thro' covetousness shall they with feigned words
  make merchandize of you</i>; for these are the Merchants of the Earth,
  who trade with the great Whore, and their merchandize <a
  name="NtpJohI_21" href="#NtJohI_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> is all things of
  price, with the bodies and souls of men: <i>whose judgment&mdash;lingreth
  not, and their damnation <a name="NtpJohI_22"
  href="#NtJohI_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> slumbreth not</i>, but shall surely
  come upon them at the last day suddenly, as the flood upon <i>the old
  world</i>, and fire and brimstone upon <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrha</i>,
  when the just shall be delivered <a name="NtpJohI_23"
  href="#NtJohI_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> like <i>Lot</i>; for <i>the Lord
  knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the
  unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished</i>, in the lake of fire;
  <i>but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
  uncleanness</i>, <a name="NtpJohI_24"
  href="#NtJohI_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> being made drunk with the wine of
  the Whore's fornication; who <i>despise dominion, and are not afraid to
  blaspheme glories</i>; for the beast opened his mouth against God <a
  name="NtpJohI_25" href="#NtJohI_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> to blaspheme his
  name and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. <i>These, as
  natural brute beasts</i>, the ten-horned beast and two-horned beast, or
  false Prophet, <i>made to be taken and destroyed</i>, in the lake of
  fire, <i>blaspheme the things they understand not</i>:&mdash;they count
  it pleasure to riot in the day-time&mdash;sporting themselves with their
  own deceivings, while they feast <a name="NtpJohI_26"
  href="#NtJohI_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> with you, <i>having eyes full of an
  <a name="NtpJohI_27" href="#NtJohI_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
  Adulteress</i>: for the kingdoms of the beast live deliciously with the
  great Whore, and the nations are made drunk with the wine of her
  fornication. They <i>are gone astray, following the way of </i>Balaam<i>,
  the son of </i>Beor<i>, who loved the wages of unrighteousness</i>, the
  false Prophet <a name="NtpJohI_28" href="#NtJohI_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
  who taught <i>Balak</i> to cast a stumbling-block before the children of
  <i>Israel</i>. <i>These are</i>, not fountains of living water, but
  <i>wells without water</i>; not such clouds of Saints as the two
  witnesses ascend in, but <i>clouds that are carried with a tempest</i>,
  &amp;c. Thus does the author of this Epistle spend all the second Chapter
  in describing the qualities of the <i>Apocalyptic</i> Beasts and false
  Prophet: and then in the third he goes on to describe their destruction
  more fully, and the future kingdom. He saith, that because the coming of
  <i>Christ</i> should be long deferred, they should scoff, saying,
  <i>where is the promise of his coming</i>? Then he describes the sudden
  coming of the day of the Lord upon them, <i>as a thief in the night</i>,
  which is the <i>Apocalyptic</i> phrase; and the <i>millennium</i>, or
  <i>thousand years</i>, which <i>are with God but as a day</i>; the
  <i>passing away of the old heavens</i> and earth, by a conflagration in
  the lake of fire, and our <i>looking for new heavens and a new earth,
  wherein dwelleth righteousness</i>.</p>

  <p>Seeing therefore <i>Peter</i> and <i>John</i> were Apostles of the
  circumcision, it seems to me that they staid with their Churches in
  <i>Judea</i> and <i>Syria</i> till the <i>Romans</i> made war upon their
  nation, that is, till the twelfth year of <i>Nero</i>; that they then
  followed the main body of their flying Churches into <i>Asia</i>, and
  that <i>Peter</i> went thence by <i>Corinth</i> to <i>Rome</i>; that the
  <i>Roman</i> Empire looked upon those Churches as enemies, because
  <i>Jews</i> by birth; and therefore to prevent insurrections, secured
  their leaders, and banished <i>John</i> into <i>Patmos</i>. It seems also
  probable to me that the <i>Apocalypse</i> was there composed, and that
  soon after the Epistle to the <i>Hebrews</i> and those of <i>Peter</i>
  were written to these Churches, with reference to this Prophecy as what
  they were particularly concerned in. For it appears by these Epistles,
  that they were written in times of general affliction and tribulation
  under the heathens, and by consequence when the Empire made war upon the
  <i>Jews</i>; for till then the heathens were at peace with the
  <i>Christian Jews</i>, as well as with the rest. The Epistle to the
  <i>Hebrews</i>, since it mentions <i>Timothy</i> as related to those
  <i>Hebrews</i>, must be written to them after their flight into
  <i>Asia</i>, where <i>Timothy</i> was Bishop; and by consequence after
  the war began, the <i>Hebrews</i> in <i>Judea</i> being strangers to
  <i>Timothy</i>. <i>Peter</i> seems also to call <i>Rome</i>
  <i>Babylon</i>, as well with respect to the war made upon <i>Judea</i>,
  and the approaching captivity, like that under old <i>Babylon</i>, as
  with respect to that name in the <i>Apocalypse</i>: and in writing <i>to
  the strangers scattered thro'out </i>Pontus<i>, </i>Galatia<i>,
  </i>Cappadocia<i>, </i>Asia<i> and </i>Bithynia, he seems to intimate
  that they were the strangers newly scattered by the <i>Roman</i> wars;
  for those were the only strangers there belonging to his care.</p>

  <p>This account of things agrees best with history when duly rectified.
  For <a name="NtpJohI_29" href="#NtJohI_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
  <i>Justin</i> and <a name="NtpJohI_30"
  href="#NtJohI_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> <i>Irenæus</i> say, that <i>Simon
  Magus</i> came to <i>Rome</i> in the reign of <i>Claudius</i>, and
  exercised juggling tricks there. <i>Pseudo-Clemens</i> adds, that he
  endeavoured there to fly, but broke his neck thro' the prayers of
  <i>Peter</i>. Whence <a name="NtpJohI_31"
  href="#NtJohI_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> <i>Eusebius</i>, or rather his
  interpolator <i>Jerom</i>, has recorded, that <i>Peter</i> came to
  <i>Rome</i> in the second year of <i>Claudius</i>: but <a
  name="NtpJohI_32" href="#NtJohI_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> <i>Cyril</i>
  Bishop of <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>Philastrius</i>, <i>Sulpitius</i>,
  <i>Prosper</i>, <i>Maximus Taurinensis</i>, and <i>Hegesippus junior</i>,
  place this victory of <i>Peter</i> in the time of <i>Nero</i>. Indeed the
  antienter tradition was, that <i>Peter</i> came to <i>Rome</i> in the
  days of this Emperor, as may be seen in <a name="NtpJohI_33"
  href="#NtJohI_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> <i>Lactantius</i>.
  <i>Chrysostom</i> <a name="NtpJohI_34"
  href="#NtJohI_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> tells us, that the Apostles
  continued long in <i>Judea</i>, and that then being driven out by the
  <i>Jews</i> they went to the <i>Gentiles</i>. This dispersion was in the
  first year of the <i>Jewish</i> war, when the <i>Jews</i>, as
  <i>Josephus</i> tells us, began to be tumultuous and violent in all
  places. For all agree that the Apostles were dispersed into several
  regions at once; and <i>Origen</i> has set down the time, <a
  name="NtpJohI_35" href="#NtJohI_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> telling us that
  in the beginning of the <i>Judaic</i> war, the Apostles and disciples of
  our Lord were scattered into all nations; <i>Thomas</i> into
  <i>Parthia</i>, <i>Andrew</i> into <i>Scythia</i>, <i>John</i> into
  <i>Asia</i>, and <i>Peter</i> first into <i>Asia</i>, where he preacht to
  the dispersion, and thence into <i>Italy</i>. <a name="NtpJohI_36"
  href="#NtJohI_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> <i>Dionysius Corinthius</i> saith,
  that <i>Peter</i> went from <i>Asia</i> by <i>Corinth</i> to <i>Rome</i>,
  and all antiquity agrees that <i>Peter</i> and <i>Paul</i> were martyred
  there in the end of <i>Nero</i>'s reign. <i>Mark</i> went with
  <i>Timothy</i> to <i>Rome</i>, 2 <i>Tim.</i> iv. 11. <i>Colos.</i> iv.
  10. <i>Sylvanus</i> was <i>Paul</i>'s assistant; and by the companions of
  <i>Peter</i>, mentioned in his first Epistle, we may know that he wrote
  from <i>Rome</i>; and the Antients generally agree, that in this Epistle
  he understood <i>Rome</i> by <i>Babylon</i>. His second Epistle was writ
  to the same dispersed strangers with the first, 2 <i>Pet.</i> iii. 1. and
  therein he saith, that <i>Paul</i> had writ of the same things to them,
  and also in his other Epistles, <i>ver.</i> 15, 16. Now as there is no
  Epistle of <i>Paul</i> to these strangers besides that to the
  <i>Hebrews</i>, so in this Epistle, chap. x. 11, 12. we find at large all
  those things which <i>Peter</i> had been speaking of, and here refers to;
  particularly the <i>passing away of the old heavens and earth</i>, and
  <i>establishing an inheritance immoveable</i>, with an exhortation to
  grace, because <i>God</i>, to the wicked, <i>is a consuming fire</i>,
  Heb. xii. 25, 26, 28, 29.</p>

  <p>Having determined the time of writing the <i>Apocalyse</i>, I need not
  say much about the truth of it, since it was in such request with the
  first ages, that many endeavoured to imitate it, by feigning
  <i>Apocalypses</i> under the Apostles names; and the Apostles themselves,
  as I have just now shewed, studied it, and used its phrases; by which
  means the style of the Epistle to the <i>Hebrews</i> became more mystical
  than that of <i>Paul</i>'s other Epistles, and the style of <i>John</i>'s
  Gospel more figurative and majestical than that of the other Gospels. I
  do not apprehend that <i>Christ</i> was called the word of God in any
  book of the New Testament written before the <i>Apocalypse</i>; and
  therefore am of opinion, the language was taken from this Prophecy, as
  were also many other phrases in this Gospel, such as those of
  <i>Christ</i>'s being <i>the light which enlightens the world, the lamb
  of God which taketh away the sins of the world, the bridegroom, he that
  testifieth, he that came down from heaven, the Son of God</i>, &amp;c.
  <i>Justin Martyr</i>, who within thirty years after <i>John</i>'s death
  became a <i>Christian</i>, writes expresly that <i>a certain man among
  the </i>Christians<i> whose name was </i>John<i>, one of the twelve
  Apostles of </i>Christ<i>, in the Revelation which was shewed him,
  prophesied that those who believed in </i>Christ<i> should live a
  thousand years at </i>Jerusalem. And a few lines before he saith: <i>But
  I, and as many as are </i>Christians<i>, in all things right in their
  opinions, believe both that there shall be a resurrection of the flesh,
  and a thousand years life at </i>Jerusalem<i> built, adorned and
  enlarged</i>. Which is as much as to say, that all true <i>Christians</i>
  in that early age received this Prophecy: for in all ages, as many as
  believed the thousand years, received the <i>Apocalypse</i> as the
  foundation of their opinion: and I do not know one instance to the
  contrary. <i>Papias</i> Bishop of <i>Hierapolis</i>, a man of the
  Apostolic age, and one of <i>John</i>'s own disciples, did not only teach
  the doctrine of the thousand years, but also <a name="NtpJohI_37"
  href="#NtJohI_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> asserted the <i>Apocalypse</i> as
  written by divine inspiration. <i>Melito</i>, who flourished next after
  <i>Justin</i>, <a name="NtpJohI_38" href="#NtJohI_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
  wrote a commentary upon this Prophecy; and he, being Bishop of
  <i>Sardis</i> one of the seven Churches, could neither be ignorant of
  their tradition about it, nor impose upon them. <i>Irenæus</i>, who was
  contemporary with <i>Melito</i>, wrote much upon it, and said, that
  <i>the number 666 was in all the antient and approved copies; and that he
  had it also confirmed to him by those who had seen </i>John<i> face to
  face</i>, meaning no doubt his master <i>Polycarp</i> for one. At the
  same time <a name="NtpJohI_39" href="#NtJohI_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
  <i>Theophilus</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i> asserted it, and so did
  <i>Tertullian</i>, <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>, and <i>Origen</i> soon
  after; and their contemporary <i>Hippolytus</i> the Martyr, Metropolitan
  of the <i>Arabians</i>, <a name="NtpJohI_40"
  href="#NtJohI_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> wrote a commentary upon it. All
  these were antient men, flourishing within a hundred and twenty years
  after <i>John</i>'s death, and of greatest note in the Churches of those
  times. Soon after did <i>Victorinus Pictaviensis</i> write another
  commentary upon it; and he lived in the time of <i>Dioclesian</i>. This
  may surely suffice to shew how the <i>Apocalypse</i> was received and
  studied in the first ages: and I do not indeed find any other book of the
  New Testament so strongly attested, or commented upon so early as this.
  The Prophecy said: <i>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the
  words of this Prophecy, and keep the things which are written
  therein.</i> This animated the first <i>Christians</i> to study it so
  much, till the difficulty made them remit, and comment more upon the
  other books of the New Testament. This was the state of the
  <i>Apocalypse</i>, till the thousand years being misunderstood, brought a
  prejudice against it: and <i>Dionysius</i> of <i>Alexandria</i>, noting
  how it abounded with barbarisms, that is with <i>Hebraisms</i>, promoted
  that prejudice so far, as to cause many <i>Greeks</i> in the fourth
  century to doubt of the book. But whilst the <i>Latins</i>, and a great
  part of the <i>Greeks</i>, always retained the <i>Apocalypse</i>, and the
  rest doubted only out of prejudice, it makes nothing against its
  authority.</p>

  <p>This Prophecy is called <i>the Revelation</i>, with respect to <i>the
  scripture of truth</i>, which <i>Daniel</i> <a name="NtpJohI_41"
  href="#NtJohI_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> was commanded to <i>shut up and
  seal, till the time of the end</i>. <i>Daniel</i> sealed it <i>until the
  time of the end</i>; and until that time comes, the Lamb is opening the
  seals: and afterwards the two Witnesses prophesy out of it a long time in
  sack-cloth, before they ascend up to heaven in a cloud. All which is as
  much as to say, that these Prophecies of <i>Daniel</i> and <i>John</i>
  should not be understood till the time of the end: but then some should
  prophesy out of them in an afflicted and mournful state for a long time,
  and that but darkly, so as to convert but few. But in the very end, the
  Prophecy should be so far interpreted as to convince many. <i>Then</i>,
  saith <i>Daniel, many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
  encreased</i>. For the Gospel must be preached in all nations before the
  great tribulation, and end of the world. The palm-bearing multitude,
  which come out of this great tribulation, cannot be innumerable out of
  all nations, unless they be made so by the preaching of the Gospel before
  it comes. There must be a stone cut out of a mountain without hands,
  before it can fall upon the toes of the Image, and become a great
  mountain and fill the earth. An Angel must fly thro' the midst of heaven
  with the everlasting Gospel to preach to all nations, before
  <i>Babylon</i> falls, and the Son of man reaps his harvest. The two
  Prophets must ascend up to heaven in a cloud, before the kingdoms of this
  world become the kingdoms of <i>Christ</i>. 'Tis therefore a part of this
  Prophecy, that it should not be understood before the last age of the
  world; and therefore it makes for the credit of the Prophecy, that it is
  not yet understood. But if the last age, the age of opening these things,
  be now approaching, as by the great successes of late Interpreters it
  seems to be, we have more encouragement than ever to look into these
  things. If the general preaching of the Gospel be approaching, it is to
  us and our posterity that those words mainly belong: <a name="NtpJohI_42"
  href="#NtJohI_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> <i>In the time of the end the wise
  shall understand, but none of the wicked shall understand. <a
  name="NtpJohI_43" href="#NtJohI_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> Blessed is he
  that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophecy, and keep
  those things which are written therein.</i></p>

  <p>The folly of Interpreters has been, to foretel times and things by
  this Prophecy, as if God designed to make them Prophets. By this rashness
  they have not only exposed themselves, but brought the Prophecy also into
  contempt. The design of God was much otherwise. He gave this and the
  Prophecies of the Old Testament, not to gratify men's curiosities by
  enabling them to foreknow things, but that after they were fulfilled they
  might be interpreted by the event, and his own Providence, not the
  Interpreters, be then manifested thereby to the world. For the event of
  things predicted many ages before, will then be a convincing argument
  that the world is governed by providence. For as the few and obscure
  Prophecies concerning <i>Christ</i>'s first coming were for setting up
  the <i>Christian</i> religion, which all nations have since corrupted; so
  the many and clear Prophecies concerning the things to be done at
  <i>Christ</i>'s second coming, are not only for predicting but also for
  effecting a recovery and re-establishment of the long-lost truth, and
  setting up a kingdom wherein dwells righteousness. The event will prove
  the <i>Apocalypse</i>; and this Prophecy, thus proved and understood,
  will open the old Prophets, and all together will make known the true
  religion, and establish it. For he that will understand the old Prophets,
  must begin with this; but the time is not yet come for understanding them
  perfectly, because the main revolution predicted in them is not yet come
  to pass. <i>In the days of the voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall
  begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath declared
  to his servants the Prophets</i>: and then <i>the kingdoms of this world
  shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and his </i>Christ<i>, and he shall
  reign for ever</i>, Apoc. x. 7. xi. 15. There is already so much of the
  Prophecy fulfilled, that as many as will take pains in this study, may
  see sufficient instances of God's providence: but then the signal
  revolutions predicted by all the holy Prophets, will at once both turn
  mens eyes upon considering the predictions, and plainly interpret them.
  Till then we must content ourselves with interpreting what hath been
  already fulfilled.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Interpreters of the last age there is scarce one of note
  who hath not made some discovery worth knowing; and thence I seem to
  gather that God is about opening these mysteries. The success of others
  put me upon considering it; and if I have done any thing which may be
  useful to following writers, I have my design.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the relation which the </i>Apocalypse<i>
of </i>John<i> hath to the Book of the
Law of </i>Moses<i>, and to the worship
of God in the Temple</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Apocalypse</i> of <i>John</i> is written in the same style and
  language with the Prophecies of <i>Daniel</i>, and hath the same relation
  to them which they have to one another, so that all of them together make
  but one complete Prophecy; and in like manner it consists of two parts,
  an introductory Prophecy, and an Interpretation thereof.</p>

  <p>The Prophecy is distinguish'd into seven successive parts, by the
  opening of the seven seals of the book which <i>Daniel</i> was commanded
  to seal up: and hence it is called the <i>Apocalypse</i> or
  <i>Revelation</i> of <i>Jesus Christ</i>. The time of the seventh seal is
  sub-divided into eight successive parts by the silence in heaven for half
  an hour, and the sounding of seven trumpets successively: and the seventh
  trumpet sounds to the battle of the great day of God Almighty, whereby
  <i>the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of the Lord and of his
  Christ</i>, and those are destroyed that destroyed the earth.</p>

  <p>The Interpretation begins with the words, <i>And the temple of God was
  opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the Ark of his
  Testament</i>: and it continues to the end of the Prophecy. The Temple is
  the scene of the visions, and the visions in the Temple relate to the
  feast of the seventh month: for the feasts of the <i>Jews</i> were
  typical of things to come. The Passover related to the first coming of
  <i>Christ</i>, and the feasts of the seventh month to his second coming:
  his first coming being therefore over before this Prophecy was given, the
  feasts of the seventh month are here only alluded unto.</p>

  <p>On the first day of that month, in the morning, the High-Priest
  dressed the lamps: and in allusion hereunto, this Prophecy begins with a
  vision of one like <i>the Son of man</i> in the High-Priest's habit,
  appearing as it were in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, or
  over against the midst of them, dressing the lamps, which appeared like a
  rod of seven stars in his right hand: and this dressing was perform'd by
  the sending seven Epistles to the Angels or Bishops of the seven Churches
  of <i>Asia</i>, which in the primitive times illuminated the Temple or
  Church Catholick. These Epistles contain admonitions against the
  approaching Apostacy, and therefore relate to the times when the Apostacy
  began to work strongly, and before it prevailed. It began to work in the
  Apostles days, and was to continue working <i>till the man of sin should
  be revealed</i>. It began to work in the disciples of <i>Simon</i>,
  <i>Menander</i>, <i>Carpocrates</i>, <i>Cerinthas</i>, and such sorts of
  men as had imbibed the metaphysical philosophy of the <i>Gentiles</i> and
  <i>Cabalistical Jews</i>, and were thence called <i>Gnosticks</i>.
  <i>John</i> calls them <i>Antichrists</i>, saying that in his days there
  were many <i>Antichrists</i>. But these being condemned by the Apostles,
  and their immediate disciples, put the Churches in no danger during the
  opening of the first four seals. The visions at the opening of these
  seals relate only to the civil affairs of the heathen <i>Roman</i>
  Empire. So long the Apostolic traditions prevailed, and preserved the
  Church in its purity: and therefore the affairs of the Church do not
  begin to be considered in this Prophecy before the opening of the fifth
  seal. She began then to decline, and to want admonitions; and therefore
  is admonished by these Epistles, till the Apostacy prevailed and took
  place, which was at the opening of the seventh seal. The admonitions
  therefore in these seven Epistles relate to the state of the Church in
  the times of the fifth and sixth seals. At the opening of the fifth seal,
  the Church is purged from hypocrites by a great persecution. At the
  opening of the sixth, that which letted is taken out of the way, namely
  the heathen <i>Roman</i> Empire. At the opening of the seventh, the man
  of sin is revealed. And to these times the seven Epistles relate.</p>

  <p>The seven Angels, to whom these Epistles were written, answer to the
  seven <i>Amarc-holim</i>, who were Priests and chief Officers of the
  Temple, and had jointly the keys of the gates of the Temple, with those
  of the Treasuries, and the direction, appointment and oversight of all
  things in the Temple.</p>

  <p>After the lamps were dresed, <i>John</i> saw <i>the door</i> of the
  Temple <i>opened</i>; and by <i>the voice as it were of a trumpet</i>,
  was called up to the eastern gate of the great court, to see the visions:
  and <i>behold a throne was set</i>, <i>viz.</i> the mercy-seat upon the
  Ark of the Testament, which the <i>Jews</i> respected as <i>the throne of
  God between the </i>Cherubims, <i>Exod.</i> xxv. 2. <i>Psal.</i> xcix. 1.
  <i>And he that sat on it was to look upon like </i>Jasper<i> and
  </i>Sardine<i> stone</i>, that is, of an olive colour, the people of
  <i>Judea</i> being of that colour. <i>And</i>, the Sun being then in the
  <i>East, a rainbow was about the throne</i>, the emblem of glory. <i>And
  round about the throne were four and twenty seats</i>; answering to the
  chambers of the four and twenty Princes of the Priests, twelve on the
  south side, and twelve on the north side of the Priests Court. <i>And
  upon the seats were four and twenty Elders sitting, clothed in white
  rayment, with crowns on their heads</i>; representing the Princes of the
  four and twenty courses of the Priests clothed in linen. <i>And out of
  the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings, and voices</i>,
  <i>viz.</i> the flashes of the fire upon the Altar at the
  morning-sacrifice, and the thundering voices of those that sounded the
  trumpets, and sung at the Eastern gate of the Priests Court; for these
  being between <i>John</i> and the throne appeared to him as proceeding
  from the throne. <i>And there were seven lamps of fire burning</i>, in
  the Temple, <i>before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God</i>,
  or Angels of the seven Churches, represented in the beginning of this
  Prophecy by seven stars. <i>And before the throne was a sea of glass
  clear as chrystal</i>; the brazen sea between the porch of the Temple and
  the Altar, filled with clear water. <i>And in the midst of the throne,
  and round about the throne, were four Beasts full of eyes before and
  behind</i>: that is, one Beast before the throne and one behind it,
  appearing to <i>John</i> as in the midst of the throne, and one on either
  side in the circle about it, to represent by the multitude of their eyes
  the people standing in the four sides of the peoples court. <i>And the
  first Beast was like a lion, and the second was like a calf, and the
  third had the face of a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle</i>.
  The people of <i>Israel</i> in the wilderness encamped round about the
  tabernacle, and on the east side were three tribes under the standard of
  <i>Judah</i>, on the west were three tribes under the standard of
  <i>Ephraim</i>, on the south were three tribes under the standard of
  <i>Reuben</i>, and on the north were three tribes under the standard of
  <i>Dan</i>, <i>Numb.</i> ii. And the standard of <i>Judah</i> was a Lion,
  that of <i>Ephraim</i> an Ox, that of <i>Reuben</i> a Man, and that of
  <i>Dan</i> an Eagle, as the <i>Jews</i> affirm. Whence were framed the
  hieroglyphicks of <i>Cherubims</i> and <i>Seraphims</i>, to represent the
  people of <i>Israel</i>. A <i>Cherubim</i> had one body with four faces,
  the faces of a Lion, an Ox, a Man and an Eagle, looking to the four winds
  of heaven, without turning about, as in <i>Ezekiel</i>'s vision, chap. i.
  And four <i>Seraphims</i> had the same four faces with four bodies, one
  face to every body. The four Beasts are therefore four <i>Seraphims</i>
  standing in the four sides of the peoples court; the first in the eastern
  side with the head of a Lion, the second in the western side with the
  head of an Ox, the third in the southern side with the head of a Man, the
  fourth in the northern side with the head of an Eagle: and all four
  signify together the twelve tribes of <i>Israel</i>, out of whom the
  hundred forty and four thousand were sealed, <i>Apoc.</i> vii. 4. <i>And
  the four Beasts had each of them six wings</i>, two to a tribe, in all
  twenty and four wings, answering to the twenty and four stations of the
  people. <i>And they were full of eyes within</i>, or under their wings.
  <i>And they rest not day and night</i>, or at the morning and
  evening-sacrifices, <i>saying, holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, which
  was, and is, and is to come</i>. These animals are therefore the
  Seraphims, which appeared to <i>Isaiah</i> <a name="NtpJohII_1"
  href="#NtJohII_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in a vision like this of the
  <i>Apocalypse</i>. For there also the Lord sat upon a throne in the
  temple; and the Seraphims each with six wings cried, <i>Holy, holy, holy
  Lord God of hosts. And when those animals give glory and honour and
  thanks to him that sitteth upon the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
  the four and twenty Elders</i> go into the Temple, and there <i>fall down
  before him that sitteth on the throne, and worship him that liveth for
  ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art
  worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast
  created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created</i>.
  At the morning and evening-sacrifices, so soon as the sacrifice was laid
  upon the Altar, and the drink-offering began to be poured out, the
  trumpets sounded, and the <i>Levites</i> sang by course three times; and
  every time when the trumpets sounded, the people fell down and worshiped.
  Three times therefore did the people worship; to express which number,
  the Beasts cry <i>Holy, holy, holy</i>: and the song being ended, the
  people prayed standing, till the solemnity was finished. In the mean time
  the Priests went into the Temple, and there fell down before him that sat
  upon the throne, and worshiped.</p>

  <p><i>And </i>John<i> saw, in the right hand of him that sat upon the
  throne, a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven
  seals</i>, <i>viz.</i> the book which <i>Daniel</i> was commanded to seal
  up, and which is here represented by the prophetic book of the Law laid
  up on the right side of the Ark, as it were in the right hand of him that
  sat on the throne: for the festivals and ceremonies of the Law prescribed
  to the people in this book, adumbrated those things which were predicted
  in the book of <i>Daniel</i>; and the writing within and on the backside
  of this book, relates to the synchronal Prophecies. <a name="NtpJohII_2"
  href="#NtJohII_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>And none was found worthy to open
  the book</i> but the Lamb of God. <i>And lo, in the midst of the throne
  and of the four Beasts, and in the midst of the Elders</i>, that is, at
  the foot of the Altar, <i>stood a lamb as it had been slain</i>, the
  morning-sacrifice; <i>having seven horns</i>, which are the seven
  Churches, <i>and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent
  forth into all the earth. And he came, and took the book out of the right
  hand of him that sat upon the throne: And when he had taken the book, the
  four Beasts and four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having
  every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the
  prayers of saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
  take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
  hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue,
  and people, and nation; and hast made us, unto our God, Kings and
  Priests, and we shall reign on the earth.</i> The Beasts and Elders
  therefore represent the primitive <i>Christians</i> of all nations; and
  the worship of these <i>Christians</i> in their Churches is here
  represented under the form of worshiping God and the Lamb in the Temple:
  God for his benefaction in creating all things, and the Lamb for his
  benefaction in redeeming us with his blood: God as sitting upon the
  throne and living for ever, and the Lamb as exalted above all by the
  merits of his death. <i>And I heard</i>, saith <i>John</i>, <i>the voice
  of many Angels round about the throne, and the Beasts and the Elders: and
  the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
  thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
  receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and
  glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the
  earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
  in them, heard I, saying, Blessing, honour, glory, and power, be unto him
  that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. And
  the four Beasts said, </i>Amen<i>. And the four and twenty Elders fell
  down and worshiped him that liveth for ever and ever.</i> This was the
  worship of the primitive <i>Christians</i>.</p>

  <p>It was the custom for the High-Priest, seven days before the fast of
  the seventh month, to continue constantly in the Temple, and study the
  book of the Law, that he might be perfect in it against the day of
  expiation; wherein the service, which was various and intricate, was
  wholly to be performed by himself; part of which service was reading the
  Law to the people: and to promote his studying it, there were certain
  Priests appointed by the <i>Sanhedrim</i> to be with him those seven days
  in one of his chambers in the Temple, and there to discourse with him
  about the Law, and read it to him, and put him in mind of reading and
  studying it himself. This his opening and reading the Law those seven
  days, is alluded unto in the Lamb's opening the seals. We are to conceive
  that those seven days begin in the evening before each day; for the
  <i>Jews</i> began their day in the evening, and that the solemnity of the
  fast begins in the morning of the seventh day.</p>

  <p>The seventh seal was therefore opened on the day of expiation, and
  then <i>there was silence in heaven for half an hour. And an Angel</i>,
  the High-Priest, <i>stood at the Altar, having a golden Censer; and there
  was given him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of
  all Saints, upon the golden Altar which was before the throne</i>. The
  custom was on other days, for one of the Priests to take fire from the
  great Altar in a silver Censer; but on this day, for the High-Priest to
  take fire from the great Altar in a golden Censer: and when he was come
  down from the great Altar, he took incense from one of the Priests who
  brought it to him, and went with it to the golden Altar: and while he
  offered the incense, the people prayed without in silence, which is the
  silence in heaven for half an hour. When the High-Priest had laid the
  incense on the Altar, he carried a Censer of it burning in his hand, into
  the most holy place before the Ark. <i>And the smoke of the incense, with
  the prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God out of the Angel's
  hand.</i> On other days there was a certain measure of incense for the
  golden Altar: on this day there was a greater quantity for both the Altar
  and the most holy Place, and therefore it is called <i>much incense</i>.
  After this <i>the Angel took the Censer, and filled it with fire from
  the</i> great <i>Altar, and cast it into the earth</i>; that is, by the
  hands of the Priests who belong to his mystical body, he cast it to the
  earth without the Temple, for burning the Goat which was the Lord's lot.
  <i>And</i> at this and other concomitant sacrifices, until the
  evening-sacrifice was ended, <i>there were voices, and thundrings, and
  lightnings, and an earthquake</i>; that is, the voice of the High-Priest
  reading the Law to the people, and other voices and thundrings from the
  trumpets and temple-musick at the sacrifices, and lightnings from the
  fire of the Altar.</p>

  <p>The solemnity of the day of expiation being finished, the seven Angels
  found their trumpets at the great sacrifices of the seven days of the
  feast of tabernacles; and at the same sacrifices, the seven thunders
  utter their voices, which are the musick of the Temple, and singing of
  the <i>Levites</i>, intermixed with the soundings of the trumpets: and
  the seven Angels pour out their vials of wrath, which are the
  drink-offerings of those sacrifices.</p>

  <p>When six of the seals were opened, <i>John</i> said: <a
  name="NtpJohII_3" href="#NtJohII_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <i>And after these
  things</i>, that is, after the visions of the sixth seal, <i>I saw four
  Angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds
  of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea,
  nor on any tree. And I saw another Angel ascending from the </i>East<i>,
  having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the
  four Angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying,
  Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the
  servants of our God in their foreheads.</i> This sealing alludes to a
  tradition of the <i>Jews</i>, that upon the day of expiation all the
  people of <i>Israel</i> are sealed up in the books of life and death. For
  the <i>Jews</i> in their <i>Talmud</i> <a name="NtpJohII_4"
  href="#NtJohII_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> tell us, that in the beginning of
  every new year, or first day of the month <i>Tisri</i>, the seventh month
  of the sacred year, three books are opened in judgment; the book of life,
  in which the names of those are written who are perfectly just; the book
  of death, in which the names of those are written who are Atheists or
  very wicked; and a third book, of those whose judgment is suspended till
  the day of expiation, and whose names are not written in the book of life
  or death before that day. The first ten days of this month they call the
  penitential days; and all these days they fast and pray very much, and
  are very devout, that on the tenth day their sins may be remitted, and
  their names may be written in the book of life; which day is therefore
  called the day of expiation. And upon this tenth day, in returning home
  from the Synagogues, they say to one another, <i>God the creator seal you
  to a good year</i>. For they conceive that the books are now sealed up,
  and that the sentence of God remains unchanged henceforward to the end of
  the year. The same thing is signified by the two Goats, upon whose
  foreheads the High-Priest yearly, on the day of expiation, lays the two
  lots inscribed, <i>For God</i> and <i>For </i>Azazel; God's lot
  signifying the people who are sealed with the name of God in their
  foreheads; and the lot <i>Azazel</i>, which was sent into the wilderness,
  representing those who receive the mark and name of the Beast, and go
  into the wilderness with the great Whore.</p>

  <p>The servants of God being therefore sealed in the day of expiation, we
  may conceive that this sealing is synchronal to the visions which appear
  upon opening the seventh seal; and that when the Lamb had opened six of
  the seals and seen the visions relating to the inside of the sixth, he
  looked on the backside of the seventh leaf, and then saw <i>the four
  Angels holding the four winds of heaven, and another Angel ascending from
  the </i>East<i> with the seal of God</i>. Conceive also, that the Angels
  which held the four winds were the first four of the seven Angels, who
  upon opening the seventh seal were seen standing before God; and that
  upon their holding the winds, <i>there was silence in heaven for half an
  hour</i>; and that while the servants of God were sealing, the Angel with
  the golden Censer offered their prayers with incense upon the golden
  Altar, and read the Law: and that so soon as they were sealed, the winds
  hurt the earth at the sounding of the first trumpet, and the sea at the
  sounding of the second; these winds signifying the wars, to which the
  first four trumpets sounded. For as the first four seals are
  distinguished from the three last by the appearance of four horsemen
  towards the four winds of heaven; so the wars of the first four trumpets
  are distinguished from those of the three last, by representing these by
  <i>four winds</i>, and the others by <i>three great woes</i>.</p>

  <p>In one of <i>Ezekiel</i>'s visions, when the <i>Babylonian</i>
  captivity was at hand, <i>six men</i> appeared <i>with
  slaughter-weapons</i>; <i>and a seventh</i>, who <a name="NtpJohII_5"
  href="#NtJohII_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> appeared <i>among them clothed in
  white linen and a writer's ink-horn by his side</i>, is commanded to
  <i>go thro' the midst of </i>Jerusalem<i>, and set a mark upon the
  foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations done in
  the midst thereof</i>: and then the six men, like the Angels of the first
  six trumpets, are commanded to slay those men who are not marked.
  Conceive therefore that the hundred forty and four thousand are sealed,
  to preserve them from the plagues of the first six trumpets; and that at
  length by the preaching of the everlasting gospel, they grow into <i>a
  great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds,
  and people and tongues</i>: and at the sounding of the seventh trumpet
  come out of the great tribulation <i>with Palms in their hands: the
  kingdoms of this world</i>, by the war to which that trumpet sounds,
  <i>becoming the kingdoms of God and his </i>Christ. For the solemnity of
  the great <i>Hosannah</i> was kept by the <i>Jews</i> upon the seventh or
  last day of the feast of tabernacles; the <i>Jews</i> upon that day
  carrying Palms in their hands, and crying <i>Hosannah</i>.</p>

  <p>After six of the Angels, answering to the six men with
  slaughter-weapons, had sounded their trumpets, the Lamb in the form of
  <i>a mighty Angel cane down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a
  rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the Sun, and his
  feet as pillars of fire</i>, the shape in which <i>Christ</i> appeared in
  the beginning of this Prophecy; <i>and he had in his hand a little book
  open</i>, the book which he had newly opened; for he received but one
  book from him that sitteth upon the throne, and he alone was worthy to
  open and look on this book. <i>And he set his right foot upon the sea and
  his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion
  roareth</i>. It was the custom for the High-Priest on the day of
  expiation, to stand in an elevated place in the peoples court, at the
  Eastern gate of the Priests court, and read the Law to the people, while
  the Heifer and the Goat which was the Lord's lot, were burning without
  the Temple. We may therefore suppose him standing in such a manner, that
  his right foot might appear to <i>John</i> as it were standing on the sea
  of glass, and his left foot on the ground of the house; and that he cried
  with a loud voice, in reading the Law on the day of expiation. <i>And
  when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices</i>. Thunders are
  the voice of a cloud, and a cloud signifies a multitude; and this
  multitude may be the <i>Levites</i>, who sang with thundering voices, and
  played with musical instruments at the great sacrifices, on the seven
  days of the feast of Tabernacles: at which times the trumpets also
  sounded. For the trumpets sounded, and the <i>Levites</i> sang
  alternately, three times at every sacrifice. The Prophecy therefore of
  the seven thunders is nothing else than a repetition of the Prophecy of
  the seven trumpets in another form. <i>And the Angel which I saw stand
  upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware
  by him that liveth for ever and ever, that</i> after the seven thunders
  <i>there should be time no longer; but in the days of the voice of the
  seventh Angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be
  finished, as he hath declared to his servants the Prophets</i>. The
  voices of the thunders therefore last to the end of this world, and so do
  those of the trumpets.</p>

  <p><i>And the voice which I heard from heaven</i>, saith <i>John</i>,
  <i>spake unto me again and said, Go and take the little book, &amp;c. And
  I took the little book out of the Angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was
  in my mouth sweet as honey, and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
  bitter. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
  peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings</i>. This is an introduction
  to a new Prophecy, to a repetition of the Prophecy of the whole book; and
  alludes to <i>Ezekiel</i>'s eating a roll or book spread open before him,
  and written within and without, full of lamentations and mourning and
  woe, but sweet in his mouth. Eating and drinking signify acquiring and
  possessing; and eating the book is becoming inspired with the Prophecy
  contained in it. It implies being inspired in a vigorous and
  extraordinary manner with the Prophecy of the whole book, and therefore
  signifies a lively repetition of the whole Prophecy by way of
  interpretation, and begins not till the first Prophecy, that of the seals
  and trumpets, is ended. It was sweet in <i>John</i>'s mouth, and
  therefore begins not with the bitter Prophecy of the <i>Babylonian</i>
  captivity, and the <i>Gentiles</i> being in the outward court of the
  Temple, and treading the holy city under foot; and the prophesying of the
  <i>two Witnesses</i> in sackcloth, and their smiting the earth with all
  plagues, and being killed by the Beast; but so soon as the Prophecy of
  the trumpets is ended, it begins with the sweet Prophecy of the glorious
  <i>Woman in heaven</i>, and the victory of <i>Michael</i> over the
  Dragon; and after that, it is bitter in <i>John</i>'s belly, by a large
  description of the times of the great Apostacy.</p>

  <p><i>And the Angel stood</i>, upon the earth and sea, <i>saying, Rise
  and measure the Temple of God and the Altar, and them that worship
  therein</i>, that is, their courts with the buildings thereon,
  <i>viz.</i> the square court of the Temple called the separate place, and
  the square court of the Altar called the Priests court, and the court of
  them that worship in the Temple called the new court: <i>but the</i>
  great <i>court which is without the Temple, leave out, and measure it
  not, for it is given to the </i>Gentiles<i>, and the holy city shall they
  tread under foot forty and two months</i>. This measuring hath reference
  to <i>Ezekiel</i>'s measuring the Temple <i>of Solomon</i>: there the
  whole Temple, including the outward court, was measured, to signify that
  it should be rebuilt in the latter days. Here the courts of the Temple
  and Altar, and they who worship therein, are only measured, to signify
  the building of a second Temple, for those that are sealed out of all the
  twelve tribes of <i>Israel</i>, and worship in the inward court of
  sincerity and truth: but <i>John</i> is commanded to leave out the
  outward court, or outward form of religion and Church-government, because
  it is given to the <i>Babylonian Gentiles</i>. For the glorious woman in
  heaven, the remnant of whole seed kept the commandments of God, and had
  the testimony of <i>Jesus</i>, continued the same woman in outward form
  after her flight into the wilderness, whereby she quitted her former
  sincerity and piety, and became the great Whore. She lost her chastity,
  but kept her outward form and shape. And while the <i>Gentiles</i> tread
  the holy city underfoot, and worship in the outward court, the two
  witnesses, represented perhaps by the two feet of the Angel standing on
  the sea and earth, prophesied against them, and <i>had power</i>, like
  <i>Elijah</i> and <i>Moses</i>, <i>to consume their enemies with fire
  proceeding out of their mouth, and to shut heaven that it rain not in the
  days of their Prophecy, and to turn the waters into blood, and to smite
  the earth with all plagues as often as they will</i>, that is, with the
  plagues of the trumpets and vials of wrath; and at length they are slain,
  rise again from the dead, and ascend up to heaven in a cloud; and then
  the seventh trumpet sounds to the day of judgment.</p>

  <p>The Prophecy being finished, <i>John</i> is inspired anew by the eaten
  book, and begins the Interpretation thereof with these words, <i>And the
  Temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his Temple the
  Ark of the Testament</i>. By the Ark, we may know that this was the first
  Temple; for the second Temple had no Ark. <i>And there were lightnings,
  and voices, and thundrings, and an earthquake, and great hail</i>. These
  answer to the wars in the <i>Roman</i> Empire, during the reign of the
  four horsemen, who appeared upon opening the first four seals. <i>And
  there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with the
  Sun</i>. In the Prophecy, the affairs of the Church begin to be
  considered at the opening of the fifth seal; and in the Interpretation,
  they begin at the same time with the vision of the Church in the form of
  a woman in heaven: there she is persecuted, and here she is pained in
  travail. The Interpretation proceeds down first to the sealing of the
  servants of God, and marking the rest with the mark of the Beast; and
  then to the day of judgment, represented by a harvest and vintage. Then
  it returns back to the times of opening the seventh seal, and interprets
  the Prophecy of the seven trumpets by the pouring out of seven vials of
  wrath. The Angels who pour them out, come out of the <i>Temple of the
  Tabernacle</i>; that is, out of the second Temple, for the Tabernacle had
  no outward court. Then it returns back again to the times of measuring
  the Temple and Altar, and of the <i>Gentiles</i> worshiping in the
  outward court, and of the Beast killing the witnesses in the streets of
  the great city; and interprets these things by the vision of <i>a woman
  sitting on the Beast, drunken with the blood of the Saints</i>; and
  proceeds in the interpretation downwards to the fall of the great city
  and the day of judgment.</p>

  <p>The whole Prophecy of the book, represented by the book of the Law, is
  therefore repeated, and interpreted in the visions which follow those of
  sounding the seventh trumpet, and begin with that of the Temple of God
  opened in heaven. Only the things, which the seven thunders uttered, were
  not written down, and therefore not interpreted.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Of the relation which the Prophecy of
</i>John<i> hath to those of </i>Daniel<i>; and
of the Subject of the Prophecy</i>.</p>

  <p>The whole scene of sacred Prophecy is composed of three principal
  parts: the regions beyond <i>Euphrates</i>, represented by the two first
  Beasts of <i>Daniel</i>; the Empire of the <i>Greeks</i> on this side of
  <i>Euphrates</i>, represented by the Leopard and by the He-Goat; and the
  Empire of the <i>Latins</i> on this side of <i>Greece</i>, represented by
  the Beast with ten horns. And to these three parts, the phrases of the
  <i>third part of the earth, sea, rivers, trees, ships, stars, sun, and
  moon</i>, relate. I place the body of the fourth Beast on this side of
  <i>Greece</i>, because the three first of the four Beasts had their lives
  prolonged after their dominion was taken away, and therefore belong not
  to the body of the fourth. He only stamped them with his feet.</p>

  <p>By the <i>earth</i>, the <i>Jews</i> understood the great continent of
  all <i>Asia</i> and <i>Africa</i>, to which they had access by land: and
  by the Isles of the <i>sea</i>, they understood the places to which they
  sailed by sea, particularly all <i>Europe</i>: and hence in this
  Prophecy, the <i>earth</i> and <i>sea</i> are put for the nations of the
  <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Empires.</p>

  <p>The third and fourth Beasts of <i>Daniel</i> are the same with the
  Dragon and ten-horned Beast of <i>John</i>, but with this difference:
  <i>John</i> puts the Dragon for the whole <i>Roman</i> Empire while it
  continued entire, because it was entire when that Prophecy was given; and
  the Beast he considers not till the Empire became divided: and then he
  puts the Dragon for the Empire of the <i>Greeks</i>, and the Beast for
  the Empire of the <i>Latins</i>. Hence it is that the Dragon and Beast
  have common heads and common horns: but the Dragon hath crowns only upon
  his heads, and the Beast only upon his horns; because the Beast and his
  horns reigned not before they were divided from the Dragon: and when the
  Dragon gave the Beast his throne, the ten horns received power as Kings,
  the same hour with the Beast. The heads are seven successive Kings. Four
  of them were the four horsemen which appeared at the opening of the first
  four seals. In the latter end of the sixth head, or seal, considered as
  present in the visions, it is said, <i>five</i> of the seven Kings <i>are
  fallen, and one is, and another is not yet come; and the Beast that was
  and is not</i>, being wounded to death with a sword, <i>he is the eighth,
  and of the seven</i>: he was therefore a collateral part of the seventh.
  The horns are the same with those of <i>Daniel</i>'s fourth Beast,
  described above.</p>

  <p>The four horsemen which appear at the opening of the first four seals,
  have been well explained by Mr. <i>Mede</i>; excepting that I had rather
  continue the third to the end of the reign of the three <i>Gordians</i>
  and <i>Philip</i> the <i>Arabian</i>, those being Kings from the
  <i>South</i>, and begin the fourth with the reign of <i>Decius</i>, and
  continue it till the reign of <i>Dioclesian</i>. For the fourth horseman
  <i>sat upon a pale</i> horse, <i>and his name was Death; and hell
  followed with him; and power was given them to kill unto the fourth part
  of the earth, with the sword, and with famine, and with the plague, and
  with the Beasts of the earth</i>, or armies of invaders and rebels: and
  as such were the times during all this interval. Hitherto the
  <i>Roman</i> Empire continued in an undivided monarchical form, except
  rebellions; and such it is represented by the four horsemen. But
  <i>Dioclesian</i> divided it between himself and <i>Maximianus</i>, A.C.
  285; and it continued in that divided state, till the victory of
  <i>Constantine</i> the great over <i>Licinius</i>, A.C. 323, which put an
  end to the heathen persecutions set on foot by <i>Dioclesian</i> and
  <i>Maximianus</i>, and described at the opening of the fifth seal. But
  this division of the Empire was imperfect, the whole being still under
  one and the same Senate. The same victory of <i>Constantine</i> over
  <i>Licinius</i> a heathen persecutor, began the fall of the heathen
  Empire, described at the opening of the sixth seal: and the visions of
  this seal continue till after the reign of <i>Julian</i> the Apostate, he
  being a heathen Emperor, and reigning over the whole <i>Roman</i>
  Empire.</p>

  <p>The affairs of the Church begin to be considered at the opening of the
  fifth seal, as was said above. Then she is represented by <i>a woman</i>
  in the Temple of heaven, <i>clothed with the sun</i> of righteousness,
  <i>and the moon</i> of <i>Jewish</i> ceremonies <i>under her feet, and
  upon her head a crown of twelve stars</i> relating to the twelve Apostles
  and to the twelve tribes of <i>Israel</i>. When she fled from the Temple
  into the wilderness, she left in the Temple a <i>remnant of her seed, who
  kept the commandments of God, and had the testimony of Jesus Christ</i>;
  and therefore before her flight she represented the true primitive Church
  of God, tho afterwards she degenerated like <i>Aholah</i> and
  <i>Aholibah</i>. In <i>Diocesian</i>'s persecution <i>she cried,
  travelling in birth, and pained to be delivered</i>. And in the end of
  that persecution, by the victory of <i>Constantine</i> over
  <i>Maxentius</i> A.C. 312, <i>she brought forth a man-child</i>, such a
  child as <i>was to rule all nations with a rod of iron</i>, a
  <i>Christian</i> Empire. <i>And her child</i>, by the victory of
  <i>Constantine</i> over <i>Licinius</i>, A.C. 323, <i>was caught up unto
  God and to his throne. And the woman</i>, by the division of the
  <i>Roman</i> Empire into the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Empires,
  <i>fled</i> from the first Temple <i>into the wilderness</i>, or
  spiritually barren Empire of the <i>Latins</i>, where she is found
  afterwards sitting upon the Beast and upon the seven mountains; and is
  called <i>the great city which reigneth over the Kings of the earth</i>,
  that is, over the ten Kings who give their kingdom to her Beast.</p>

  <p>But before her flight there was war in heaven between <i>Michael</i>
  and the Dragon, the <i>Christian</i> and the heathen religions; and the
  Dragon, <i>that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, who deceiveth
  the whole world, was cast out to the earth, and his Angels were cast out
  with him</i>. And <i>John heard a voice in heaven, saying, Now is come
  salvation and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his
  </i>Christ<i>: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down. And they
  overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
  testimony. And they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore
  rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe be to the inhabiters
  of the earth and sea</i>, or people of the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>
  Empires, <i>for the devil is come down amongst you, having great wrath,
  because he knoweth that he hath but a short time</i>.</p>

  <p><i>And when the Dragon saw that he was cast down</i> from the
  <i>Roman</i> throne, and the man-child caught up thither, he
  <i>persecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child; and to
  her</i>, by the division of the <i>Roman</i> Empire between the cities of
  <i>Rome</i> and <i>Constantinople</i> A.C. 330, <i>were given two wings
  of a great eagle</i>, the symbol of the <i>Roman</i> Empire, <i>that she
  might flee</i> from the first Temple <i>into the wilderness</i> of
  <i>Arabia, to her place</i> at <i>Babylon</i> mystically so called.
  <i>And the serpent</i>, by the division of the same Empire between the
  sons of <i>Constantine</i> the great, A.C. 337, <i>cast out of his mouth
  water as a flood</i>, the <i>Western</i> Empire, <i>after the woman; that
  he might cause her to be carried away by the flood. And the earth</i>, or
  <i>Greek</i> Empire, <i>helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,
  and swallowed up the flood</i>, by the victory of <i>Constantius</i> over
  <i>Magnentius</i>, A.C. 353, and thus the Beast was wounded to death with
  a sword. <i>And the Dragon was wroth with the woman</i>, in the reign of
  <i>Julian</i> the Apostate A.C. 361, <i>and</i>, by a new division of the
  Empire between <i>Valentinian</i> and <i>Valens</i>, A.C. 364,
  <i>went</i> from her into the <i>Eastern</i> Empire <i>to make war with
  the remnant of her seed</i>, which she left behind her when she fled: and
  thus the Beast revived. By the next division of the Empire, which was
  between <i>Gratian</i> and <i>Theodosius</i> A.C. 379, the <i>Beast</i>
  with ten horns <i>rose out of the sea</i>, and the <i>Beast</i> with two
  horns <i>out of the earth</i>: and by the last division thereof, which
  was between the sons of <i>Theodosius</i>, A.C. 395, <i>the Dragon gave
  the Beast his power and throne, and great authority</i>. And the ten
  horns <i>received power as Kings, the same hour with the Beast</i>.</p>

  <p>At length the woman arrived at her place of temporal as well as
  spiritual dominion upon the back of the Beast, where she is nourished
  <i>a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent</i>;
  not in his kingdom, but at a distance from him. She is nourished by
  <i>the merchants of the earth</i>, three times or years and an half, or
  42 months, or 1260 days: and in these Prophecies days are put for years.
  During all this time the Beast acted, and <i>she sat upon him</i>, that
  is, reigned over him, and over the ten Kings <i>who gave their power and
  strength</i>, that is, their kingdom <i>to the Beast</i>; and she was
  <i>drunken with the blood of the Saints</i>. By all these circumstances
  she is the eleventh horn of <i>Daniel</i>'s fourth Beast, who reigned
  with <i>a look more stout than his fellows</i>, and was of a different
  kind from the rest, and had eyes <i>and a mouth</i> like the woman;
  <i>and made war with the saints, and prevailed against them</i>, and
  <i>wore them out</i>, and <i>thought to change times and laws</i>, and
  had them <i>given into his hand, until a time, and times, and half a
  time</i>. These characters of the woman, and little horn of the Beast,
  agree perfectly: in respect of her temporal dominion, she was a horn of
  the Beast; in respect of her spiritual dominion, she rode upon him in the
  form of a woman, and was his Church, and committed fornication with the
  ten Kings.</p>

  <p>The second Beast, which <i>rose up out of the earth</i>, was the
  Church of the <i>Greek</i> Empire: for it <i>had two horns like those of
  the Lamb</i>, and therefore was a Church; and it <i>spake as the
  Dragon</i>, and therefore was of his religion; and it <i>came up out of
  the earth</i>, and by consequence in his kingdom. It is called also
  <i>the false Prophet</i> who wrought miracles before the first Beast, by
  which he deceived them that received his mark, and worshiped his image.
  When the Dragon went from the woman to make war with the remnant of her
  seed, this Beast arising out of the earth assisted in that war, and
  <i>caused the earth and them which dwell therein to worship</i> the
  authority of <i>the first Beast, whose mortal wound was healed</i>, and
  to <i>make an Image to him</i>, that is, to assemble a body of men like
  him in point of religion. He had also <i>power to give life</i> and
  authority <i>to the Image</i>, so that it could <i>both speak, and</i> by
  dictating <i>cause that all</i> religious bodies of men, <i>who would not
  worship</i> the authority of <i>the Image, should be</i> mystically
  <i>killed. And he causeth all men to receive a mark in their right hand
  or in their forehead, and that no man might buy or sell save he that had
  the mark, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name</i>; all
  the rest being excommunicated by the Beast with two horns. His mark is
  <img src="images/cross.png" alt="Cross" /> <img src="images/cross.png"
  alt="Cross" /> <img src="images/cross.png" alt="Cross" />, and his name
  <span lang="el" title="LATEINOS"
  >&#x39B;&#x391;&#x3A4;&#x395;&#x399;&#x39D;&#x39F;&#x3A3;</span>, and the
  number of his name 666.</p>

  <p>Thus the Beast, after he was wounded to death with a sword and
  revived, was deified, as the heathens used to deify their Kings after
  death, and had an Image erected to him; and his worshipers were initiated
  in this new religion, by receiving the mark or name of this new God, or
  the number of his name. By killing all that will not worship him and his
  Image, the first Temple, illuminated by the lamps of the seven Churches,
  is demolished, and a new Temple built for them who will not worship him;
  and the outward court of this new Temple, or outward form of a Church, is
  given to the <i>Gentiles</i>, who worship the Beast and his Image: while
  they who will not worship him, are sealed with the name of God in their
  foreheads, and retire into the inward court of this new Temple. These are
  the 144000 sealed out of all the twelve tribes of <i>Israel</i>, and
  called the <i>two Witnesses</i>, as being derived from the two wings of
  the woman while she was flying into the wilderness, and represented by
  two of the seven candlesticks. These appear to <i>John</i> in the inward
  court of the second Temple, standing on mount <i>Sion</i> with the Lamb,
  and as it were on the sea of glass. These are <i>the Saints of the most
  High</i>, and <i>the host of heaven</i>, and <i>the holy people</i>
  spoken of by <i>Daniel</i>, as worn out and trampled under foot, and
  destroyed in the latter times by the little horns of his fourth Beast and
  He-Goat.</p>

  <p>While the <i>Gentiles</i> tread the holy city under foot, God <i>gives
  power to his two Witnesses, and they prophesy a thousand two hundred and
  threescore days clothed in sackcloth</i>. They are called <i>the two
  Olive-trees</i>, with relation to the two Olive-trees, which in
  <i>Zechary</i>'s vision, chap. iv. stand on either side of the golden
  candlestick to supply the lamps with oil: and Olive-trees, according to
  the Apostle <i>Paul</i>, represent Churches, <i>Rom.</i> xi. They supply
  the lamps with oil, by maintaining teachers. They are also called <i>the
  two candlesticks</i>; which in this Prophecy signify Churches, the seven
  Churches of <i>Asia</i> being represented by seven candlesticks. Five of
  these Churches were found faulty, and threatned if they did not repent;
  the other two were without fault, and so their candlesticks were fit to
  be placed in the second Temple. These were the Churches in <i>Smyrna</i>
  and <i>Philadelphia</i>. They were in a state of tribulation and
  persecution, and the only two of the seven in such a state: and so their
  candlesticks were fit to represent the Churches in affliction in the
  times of the second Temple, and the only two of the seven that were fit.
  The <i>two Witnesses</i> are not new Churches: they are the posterity of
  the primitive Church, the posterity of the two wings of the woman, and so
  are fitly represented by two of the primitive candlesticks. We may
  conceive therefore, that when the first Temple was destroyed, and a new
  one built for them who worship in the inward court, two of the seven
  candlesticks were placed in this new Temple.</p>

  <p>The affairs of the Church are not considered during the opening of the
  first four seals. They begin to be consider'd at the opening of the fifth
  seal, as was said above; and are further considered at the opening of the
  sixth seal; and the seventh seal contains the times of the great
  Apostacy. And therefore I refer the Epistles to the seven Churches unto
  the times of the fifth and sixth seals: for they relate to the Church
  when she began to decline, and contain admonitions against the great
  Apostacy then approaching.</p>

  <p>When <i>Eusebius</i> had brought down his <i>Ecclesiatical History</i>
  to the reign of <i>Dioclesian</i>, he thus describes the state of the
  Church: <i>Qualem quantamque gloriam simul ac libertatem doctrina veræ
  erga supremum Deum pietatis à Christo primùm hominibus annunciata, apud
  omnes Græcos pariter &amp; barbaros ante persecutionem nostrâ memoriâ
  excitatam, consecuta sit, nos certè pro merito explicare non possumus.
  Argumento esse possit Imperatorum benignitas erga nostros: quibus
  regendas etiam provincias committebant, omni sacrificandi metu eos
  liberantes ob singularem, qua in religionem nostram affecti erant,
  benevolentiam.</i> And a little after: <i>Jam vero quis innumerabilem
  hominum quotidiè ad fidem Christi confugientium turbam, quis numerum
  ecclesiarum in singulis urbibus, quis illustres populorum concursus in
  ædibus sacris, cumulatè possit describere? Quo factum est, ut priscis
  ædificiis jam non contenti, in singulis urbibus spatiosas ab ipsis
  fundamentis exstruerent ecclesias. Atque hæc progressii temporis
  increscentia, &amp; quotidiè in majus &amp; melius proficiscentia, nec
  livor ullus atterere, nec malignitas dæmonis fascinare, nec hominum
  insidiæ prohibere unquam potuerunt, quamdiu omnipotentis Dei dextra
  populum suum, utpote tali dignum præsidio, texit atque custodiit. Sed cum
  ex nimia libertate in negligentiam ac desidiam prolapsi essemus; cum
  alter alteri invidere atque obtrectare cæpisset; cum inter nos quasi
  bella intestina gereremus, verbis, tanquam armis quibusdam hastisque, nos
  mutuò vulnerantes; cum Antistites adversus Antistites, populi in populos
  collisi, jurgia ac tumultus agitarent; denique cum fraus &amp; simulatio
  ad summum malitiæ culmen adolevisset: tum divina ultio, levi brachio ut
  solet, integro adhuc ecclesiæ statu, &amp; fidelium turbis liberè
  convenientibus, sensim ac moderatè in nos cæpit animadvertere; orsà
  primùm persecutione ab iis qui militabant. Cum verò sensu omni destituti
  de placando Dei numine ne cogitaremus quidem; quin potius instar impiorum
  quorundam res humanas nullâ providentiâ gubernari rati, alia quotidiè
  crimina aliis adjiceremus: cum Pastores nostri spretâ religionis regulâ,
  mutuis inter se contentionibus decertarent, nihil aliud quam jurgia,
  minas, æmulationem, odia, ac mutuas inimicitias amplificare studentes;
  principatum quasi tyrannidem quandam contentissimè sibi vindicantes: tunc
  demùm juxta dictum Hieremiæ, </i>obscuravit Dominus in ira sua filiam
  Sion, &amp; dejecit de cælo gloriam Israel<i>,&mdash;per Ecclesiarum
  scilicet subversionem</i>, &amp;c. This was the state of the Church just
  before the subversion of the Churches in the beginning of
  <i>Dioclesian</i>'s persecution: and to this state of the Church agrees
  the first of the seven Epistles to the Angel of the seven Churches, <a
  name="NtpJohIII_1" href="#NtJohIII_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> that to the
  Church in <i>Ephesus</i>. <i>I have something against thee</i>, saith
  <i>Christ</i> to the Angel of that Church, <i>because thou hast left thy
  first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,
  and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will
  remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent. But this
  thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the </i>Nicolaitans<i>, which I
  also hate</i>. The <i>Nicolaitans</i> are the <i>Continentes</i> above
  described, who placed religion in abstinence from marriage, abandoning
  their wives if they had any. They are here called <i>Nicolaitans</i>,
  from <i>Nicolas</i> one of the seven deacons of the primitive Church of
  <i>Jerusalem</i>; who having a beautiful wife, and being taxed with
  uxoriousness, abandoned her, and permitted her to marry whom she pleased,
  saying that we must disuse the flesh; and thenceforward lived a single
  life in continency, as his children also. The <i>Continentes</i>
  afterwards embraced the doctrine of <i>Æons</i> and Ghosts male and
  female, and were avoided by the Churches till the fourth century; and the
  Church of <i>Ephesus</i> is here commended for hating their deeds.</p>

  <p>The persecution of <i>Dioclesian</i> began in the year of
  <i>Christ</i> 302, and lasted ten years in the <i>Eastern</i> Empire and
  two years in the <i>Western</i>. To this state of the Church the second
  Epistle, to the Church of <i>Smyrna</i>, agrees. <i>I know</i>, saith <a
  name="NtpJohIII_2" href="#NtJohIII_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <i>Christ</i>,
  <i>thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, but thou art rich; and I know
  the blasphemy of them, which say they are </i>Jews<i> and are not, but
  are the synagogue of Satan. Fear none of those things which thou shalt
  suffer: Behold, the Devil shall call some of you into prison, that ye may
  be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto
  death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</i> The tribulation of ten
  days can agree to no other persecution than that of <i>Dioclesian</i>, it
  being the only persecution which lasted ten years. By <i>the blasphemy of
  them which say they are </i>Jews<i> and are not, but are the synagogue of
  Satan</i>, I understand the Idolatry of the <i>Nicolaitans</i>, who
  falsly said they were <i>Christians</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Nicolaitans</i> are complained of also in <a name="NtpJohIII_3"
  href="#NtJohIII_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the third Epistle, as men that
  <i>held the doctrine of </i>Balaam<i>, who taught </i>Balac<i> to cast a
  stumbling-block before the children of </i>Israel<i>, to eat things
  sacrificed to Idols, and <a name="NtpJohIII_4"
  href="#NtJohIII_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> to commit</i> spiritual
  <i>fornication</i>. For <i>Balaam</i> taught the <i>Moabites</i> and
  <i>Midianites</i> to tempt and invite <i>Israel</i> by their women to
  commit fornication, and to feast with them at the sacrifices of their
  Gods. The Dragon therefore began now to come down among the inhabitants
  of the earth and sea.</p>

  <p>The <i>Nicolaitans</i> are also complained of in the fourth Epistle,
  under the name of the <i>woman </i>Jezabel<i>, who calleth herself a
  Prophetess, to teach and to seduce the servants of </i>Christ<i> to
  commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to Idols</i>. The woman
  therefore began now to fly into the wilderness.</p>

  <p>The reign of <i>Constantine</i> the great from the time of his
  conquering <i>Licinius</i>, was monarchical over the whole <i>Roman</i>
  Empire. Then the Empire became divided between the sons of
  <i>Constantine</i>: and afterwards it was again united under
  <i>Constantius</i>, by his victory over <i>Magnentius</i>. To the affairs
  of the Church in these three successive periods of time, the third,
  fourth, and fifth Epistles, that is, those to the Angels of the Churches
  in <i>Pergamus</i>, <i>Thyatira</i>, and <i>Sardis</i>, seem to relate.
  The next Emperor was <i>Julian</i> the Apostate.</p>

  <p>In the sixth Epistle, <a name="NtpJohIII_5"
  href="#NtJohIII_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> to the Angel of the Church in
  <i>Philadelphia</i>, <i>Christ</i> saith: <i>Because</i> in the reign of
  the heathen Emperor <i>Julian</i>, <i>thou hast kept the word of my
  patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which</i> by
  the woman's flying into the wilderness, and the Dragon's making war with
  the remnant of her seed, and the killing of all who will not worship the
  Image of the Beast, <i>shall come upon all the world, to try them that
  dwell upon the earth</i>, and to distinguish them by sealing the one with
  the name of God in their foreheads, and marking the other with the mark
  of the Beast. <i>Him that overcometh, I will make a pillar in the Temple
  of my God; and he shall go no more out</i> of it. <i>And I will write
  upon him the name of my God</i> in his forehead. So the <i>Christians</i>
  of the Church of <i>Philadelphia</i>, as many of them as overcome, are
  sealed with the seal of God, and placed in the second Temple, and go no
  more out. The same is to be understood of the Church in <i>Smyrna</i>,
  which also kept the word of God's patience, and was without fault. These
  two Churches, with their posterity, are therefore the <i>two Pillars</i>,
  and the <i>two Candlesticks</i>, and the <i>two Witnesses</i> in the
  second Temple.</p>

  <p>After the reign of the Emperor <i>Julian,</i> and his successor
  <i>Jovian</i> who reigned but five months, the Empire became again
  divided between <i>Valentinian</i> and <i>Valens</i>. Then the Church
  Catholick, in the Epistle to the Angel of the Church of <i>Laodicea</i>,
  is reprehended as <i>lukewarm</i>, and <a name="NtpJohIII_6"
  href="#NtJohIII_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> threatned to be <i>spewed out of
  </i>Christ's<i> mouth</i>. She said, that she was <i>rich and increased
  with goods, and had need of nothing</i>, being in outward prosperity;
  <i>and knew not that she was</i> inwardly <i>wretched, and miserable, and
  poor, and blind, and naked</i>. She is therefore <i>spewed out of
  </i>Christ's<i> mouth</i> at the opening of the seventh seal: and this
  puts an end to the times of the first Temple.</p>

  <p>About one half of the <i>Roman</i> Empire turned <i>Christians</i> in
  the time of <i>Constantine</i> the great and his sons. After
  <i>Julian</i> had opened the Temples, and restored the worship of the
  heathens, the Emperors <i>Valentinian</i> and <i>Valens</i> tolerated it
  all their reign; and therefore the Prophecy of the sixth seal was not
  fully accomplished before the reign of their successor <i>Gratian</i>. It
  was the custom of the heathen Priests, in the beginning of the reign of
  every sovereign Emperor, to offer him the dignity and habit of the
  <i>Pontifex Maximus</i>. This dignity all Emperors had hitherto accepted:
  but <i>Gratian</i> rejected it, threw down the idols, interdicted the
  sacrifices, and took away their revenues with the salaries and authority
  of the Priests. <i>Theodosius</i> the great followed his example; and
  heathenism afterwards recovered itself no more, but decreased so fast,
  that <i>Prudentius</i>, about ten years after the death of
  <i>Theodosius</i>, called the heathens, <i>vix pauca ingenia &amp; pars
  hominum rarissima</i>. Whence the affairs of the sixth seal ended with
  the reign of <i>Valens</i>, or rather with the beginning of the reign of
  <i>Theodosius</i>, when he, like his predecessor <i>Gratian</i>, rejected
  the dignity of <i>Pontifex Maximus</i>. For the <i>Romans</i> were very
  much infested by the invasions of foreign nations in the reign of
  <i>Valentinian</i> and <i>Valens</i>: <i>Hoc tempore</i>, saith
  <i>Ammianus</i>, <i>velut per universum orbem Romanum bellicum canentibus
  buccinis, excitæ gentes sævissimæ limites sibi proximos persultabant:
  Gallias Rhætiasque simul Alemanni populabantur: Sarmatæ Pannonias &amp;
  Quadi: Picti, Saxones, &amp; Scoti &amp; Attacotti Britannos ærumnis
  vexavere continuis: Austoriani, Mauricæque aliæ gentes Africam solito
  acriùs incursabant: Thracias diripiebant prædatorii globi Gotthorum:
  Persarum Rex manus Armeniis injectabat</i>. And whilst the Emperors were
  busy in repelling these enemies, the <i>Hunns</i> and <i>Alans</i> and
  <i>Goths</i> came over the <i>Danube</i> in two bodies, overcame and slew
  <i>Valens</i>, and made so great a slaughter of the <i>Roman</i> army,
  that <i>Ammianus</i> saith: <i>Nec ulla Annalibus præter Cannensem ita ad
  internecionem res legitur gesta</i>. These wars were not fully stopt on
  all sides till the beginning of the reign of <i>Theodosius</i>, A.C. 379
  &amp; 380: but thenceforward the Empire remained quiet from foreign
  armies, till his death, A.C. 395. So long the four winds were held: and
  so long there was silence in heaven. And the seventh seal was opened when
  this silence began.</p>

  <p>Mr. <i>Mede</i> hath explained the Prophecy of the first six trumpets
  not much amiss: but if he had observed, that the Prophecy of pouring out
  the vials of wrath is synchronal to that of sounding the trumpets, his
  explanation would have been yet more complete.</p>

  <p>The name of <i>Woes</i> is given to the wars to which the three last
  trumpets sound, to distinguish them from the wars of the four first. The
  sacrifices on the first four days of the feast of Tabernacles, at which
  the first four trumpets sound, and the first four vials of wrath are
  poured out, are slaughters in four great wars; and these wars are
  represented by four winds from the four corners of the earth. The first
  was an east wind, the second a west wind, the third a south wind, and the
  fourth a north wind, with respect to the city of <i>Rome</i>, the
  metropolis of the old <i>Roman</i> Empire. These four plagues fell upon
  <i>the third part of the Earth, Sea, Rivers, Sun, Moon and Stars</i>;
  that is, upon the Earth, Sea, Rivers, Sun, Moon and Stars of the third
  part of the whole scene of these Prophecies of <i>Daniel</i> and
  <i>John</i>.</p>

  <p>The plague of the eastern wind <a name="NtpJohIII_7"
  href="#NtJohIII_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> at the sounding of the first
  trumpet, was to fall upon the <i>Earth</i>, that is, upon the nations of
  the <i>Greek</i> Empire. Accordingly, after the death of
  <i>Theodosius</i> the great, the <i>Goths</i>, <i>Sarmatians</i>,
  <i>Hunns</i>, <i>Isaurians</i>, and <i>Austorian</i> Moors invaded and
  miserably wasted <i>Greece</i>, <i>Thrace</i>, <i>Asia minor</i>,
  <i>Armenia</i>, <i>Syria</i>, <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Lybia</i>, and
  <i>Illyricum</i>, for ten or twelve years together.</p>

  <p>The plague of the western wind at the sounding of the second trumpet,
  was to fall upon the <i>Sea</i>, or <i>Western</i> Empire, by means of
  <i>a great mountain burning with fire</i> cast into it, and <i>turning it
  to blood</i>. Accordingly in the year 407, that Empire began to be
  invaded by the <i>Visigoths</i>, <i>Vandals</i>, <i>Alans</i>,
  <i>Sueves</i>, <i>Burgundians</i>, <i>Ostrogoths</i>, <i>Heruli</i>,
  <i>Quadi</i>, <i>Gepides</i>; and by these wars it was broken into ten
  kingdoms, and miserably wasted: and <i>Rome</i> itself, the burning
  mountain, was besieged and taken by the <i>Ostrogoths</i>, in the
  beginning of these miseries.</p>

  <p>The plague of the southern wind at the sounding of the third trumpet,
  was to cause <i>a great star, burning as it were a lamp, to fall from
  heaven upon the rivers and fountains of waters</i>, the <i>Western</i>
  Empire now divided into many kingdoms, and to turn them to
  <i>wormwood</i> and <i>blood</i>, and make them <i>bitter</i>.
  Accordingly <i>Genseric</i>, the King of the <i>Vandals</i> and
  <i>Alans</i> in <i>Spain</i>, A.C. 427, enter'd <i>Africa</i> with an
  army of eighty thousand men; where he invaded the <i>Moors</i>, and made
  war upon the <i>Romans</i>, both there and on the sea-coasts of
  <i>Europe</i>, for fifty years together, almost without intermission,
  taking <i>Hippo</i> A.C. 431, and <i>Carthage</i> the capital of
  <i>Africa</i> A.C. 439. In A.C. 455, with a numerous fleet and an army of
  three hundred thousand <i>Vandals</i> and <i>Moors</i>, he invaded
  <i>Italy</i>, took and plundered <i>Rome</i>, <i>Naples</i>,
  <i>Capua</i>, and many other cities; carrying thence their wealth with
  the flower of the people into <i>Africa</i>: and the next year, A.C. 456,
  he rent all <i>Africa</i> from the Empire, totally expelling the
  <i>Romans</i>. Then the <i>Vandals</i> invaded and took the Islands of
  the <i>Mediterranean</i>, <i>Sicily</i>, <i>Sardinia</i>, <i>Corsica</i>,
  <i>Ebusus</i>, <i>Majorca</i>, <i>Minorca</i>, &amp;c. and <i>Ricimer</i>
  besieged the Emperer <i>Anthemius</i> in <i>Rome</i>, took the city, and
  gave his soldiers the plunder, A.C. 472. The <i>Visigoths</i> about the
  same time drove the <i>Romans</i> out of <i>Spain</i>: and now the
  <i>Western</i> Emperor, the <i>great star which fell from heaven, burning
  as it were a lamp</i>, having by all these wars gradually lost almost all
  his dominions, was invaded, and conquered in one year by <i>Odoacer</i>
  King of the <i>Heruli</i>, A.C. 476. After this the <i>Moors</i> revolted
  A.C. 477, and weakned the <i>Vandals</i> by several wars, and took
  <i>Mauritania</i> from them. These wars continued till the <i>Vandals</i>
  were conquered by <i>Belisarius</i>, A.C. 534. and by all these wars
  <i>Africa</i> was almost depopulated, according to <i>Procopius</i>, who
  reckons that above five millions of men perished in them. When the
  <i>Vandals</i> first invaded <i>Africa</i>, that country was very
  populous, consisting of about 700 bishopricks, more than were in all
  <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i> and <i>Italy</i> together: but by the wars
  between the <i>Vandals</i>, <i>Romans</i> and <i>Moors</i>, it was
  depopulated to that degree, that <i>Procopius</i> tells us, it was next
  to a miracle for a traveller to see a man.</p>

  <p>In pouring out the third vial it is <a name="NtpJohIII_8"
  href="#NtJohIII_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> said: <i>Thou art righteous, O
  Lord,&mdash;because thou hast judged thus: for they have shed the blood
  of thy Saints and Prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink, for
  they are worthy</i>. How they shed the blood of Saints, may be understood
  by the following Edict of the Emperor <i>Honorius</i>, procured by four
  Bishops sent to him by a Council of <i>African</i> Bishops, who met at
  <i>Carthage</i> 14 <i>June</i>, A.C. 410.</p>

  <p>These Edicts being directed to the governor of <i>Africa</i>, extended
  only to the <i>Africans</i>. Before these there were many severe ones
  against the <i>Donatists</i>, but they did not extend to blood. These two
  were the first which made their meetings, and the meetings of all
  dissenters, capital: for by <i>hereticks</i> in these Edicts are meant
  all dissenters, as is manifest by the following against <i>Euresius</i> a
  <i>Luciferan</i> Bishop.</p>

  <p>The <i>Greek</i> Emperor <i>Zeno</i> adopted <i>Theoderic</i> King of
  the <i>Ostrogoths</i> to be his son, made him master of the horse and
  <i>Patricius</i>, and Consul of <i>Constantinople</i>; and recommending
  to him the <i>Roman</i> people and Senate, gave him the <i>Western</i>
  Empire, and sent him into <i>Italy</i> against <i>Odoacer</i> King of the
  <i>Heruli</i>. <i>Theoderic</i> thereupon led his nation into
  <i>Italy</i>, conquered <i>Odoacer</i>, and reigned over <i>Italy</i>,
  <i>Sicily</i>, <i>Rhætia</i>, <i>Noricum</i>, <i>Dalmatia</i>,
  <i>Liburnia</i>, <i>Istria</i>, and part of <i>Suevia</i>,
  <i>Pannonia</i> and <i>Gallia</i>. Whence <i>Ennodius</i> said, in a
  Panegyric to <i>Theoderic</i>: <i>Ad limitem suum Romana regna
  remeâsse.</i> <i>Theoderic</i> reigned with great prudence, moderation
  and felicity; treated the <i>Romans</i> with singular benevolence,
  governed them by their own laws, and restored their government under
  their Senate and Consuls, he himself supplying the place of Emperor,
  without assuming the title. <i>Ita sibi parentibus præfuit</i>, saith
  <i>Procopius</i>, <i>ut vere Imperatori conveniens decus nullum ipsi
  abesset: Justitiæ magnus ei cultus, legumque diligens custodia: terras à
  vicinis barbaris servavit intactas</i>, &amp;c. Whence I do not reckon
  the reign of this King, amongst the plagues of the four winds.</p>

  <p>The plague of the northern wind, at the sounding of the fourth
  trumpet, was to cause <i>the Sun, Moon and Stars</i>, that is, the King,
  kingdom and Princes of the <i>Western</i> Empire, <i>to be darkned</i>,
  and to continue some time in darkness. Accordingly <i>Belisarius</i>,
  having conquered the <i>Vandals</i>, invaded <i>Italy</i> A.C. 535, and
  made war upon the <i>Ostrogoths</i> in <i>Dalmatia</i>, <i>Liburnia</i>,
  <i>Venetia</i>, <i>Lombardy</i>, <i>Tuscany</i>, and other regions
  northward from <i>Rome</i>, twenty years together. In this war many
  cities were taken and retaken. In retaking <i>Millain</i> from the
  <i>Romans</i>, the <i>Ostrogoths</i> slew all the males young and old,
  amounting, as <i>Procopius</i> reckons, to three hundred thousand, and
  sent the women captives to their allies the <i>Burgundians</i>.
  <i>Rome</i> itself was taken and retaken several times, and thereby the
  people were thinned; the old government by a Senate ceased, the nobles
  were ruined, and all the glory of the city was extinguish'd: and A.C.
  552, after a war of seventeen years, the kingdom of the <i>Ostrogoths</i>
  fell; yet the remainder of the <i>Ostrogoths</i>, and an army of
  <i>Germans</i> called in to their assistance, continued the war three or
  four years longer. Then ensued the war of the <i>Heruli</i>, who, as
  <i>Anastasius</i> tells us, <i>perimebant cunctam Italiam</i>, slew all
  <i>Italy</i>. This was followed by the war of the <i>Lombards</i>, the
  fiercest of all the <i>Barbarians</i>, which began A.C. 568, and lasted
  for thirty eight years together; <i>factâ tali clade</i>, saith
  <i>Anastasius</i>, <i>qualem à sæculo nullus meminit</i>; ending at last
  in the Papacy of <i>Sabinian</i>, A.C. 605, by a peace then made with the
  <i>Lombards</i>. Three years before this war ended, <i>Gregory</i> the
  great, then Bishop of <i>Rome</i>, thus speaks of it: <i>Qualiter enim
  &amp; quotidianis gladiis &amp; quantis Longobardorum incursionibus, ecce
  jam per triginta quinque annorum longitudinem premimur, nullis explere
  vocibus suggestionis valemus</i>: and in one of his Sermons to the
  people, he thus expresses the great consumption of the <i>Romans</i> by
  these wars: <i>Ex illa plebe innumerabili quanti remanseritis aspicitis,
  &amp; tamen adhuc quotidiè flagella urgent, repentini casus opprimunt,
  novæ res &amp; improvisæ clades affligunt</i>. In another Sermon he thus
  describes the desolations: <i>Destructæ urbes, eversa sunt castra,
  depopulati agri, in solitudinem terra redacta est. Nullus in agris
  incola, penè nullus in urbibus habitator remansit. Et tamen ipsæ parvæ
  generis humani reliquiæ adhuc quotidiè &amp; sine cessatione feriuntur,
  &amp; finem non habent flagella c&#339;lestis justitiæ. Ipsa autem quæ
  aliquando mundi Domina esse videbatur, qualis remansit Roma conspicimus
  innumeris doloribus multipliciter attrita, defolatione civium,
  impressione hostium, frequentiâ ruinarum.&mdash;Ecce jam de illa omnes
  hujus fæculi potentes ablati sunt.&mdash;Ecce populi
  defecerunt.&mdash;Ubi enim Senatus? Ubi jam populus? Contabuerunt ossa,
  consumptæ sunt carnes. Omnis enim sæcularium dignitatum ordo extinctus
  est, &amp; tamen ipsos vos paucos qui remansimus, adhuc quotidié gladii,
  adhuc quotidié innumeræ tribulationes premunt.&mdash;Vacua jam ardet
  Roma. Quid autem ista de hominibus dicimus? Cum ruinis crebrescentibus
  ipsa quoque destrui ædificia videmus. Postquam defecerunt homines etiam
  parietes cadunt. Jam ecce desolata, ecce contrita, ecce gemitibus
  oppressa est,</i> &amp;c. All this was spoken by <i>Gregory</i> to the
  people of <i>Rome</i>, who were witnesses of the truth of it. Thus by
  <i>the plagues of the four winds</i>, the Empire of the <i>Greeks</i> was
  shaken, and the Empire of the <i>Latins</i> fell; and <i>Rome</i>
  remained nothing more than the capital of a poor dukedom, subordinate to
  <i>Ravenna</i>, the seat of the Exarchs.</p>

  <p>The fifth trumpet sounded to the wars, which the <i>King of the</i>
  South, as he is called by <i>Daniel</i>, made <i>in the time of the
  end</i>, in <i>pushing at the King who did according to his will</i>.
  This plague began with the <i>opening of the bottomless pit</i>, which
  denotes the letting out of a false religion: the <i>smoke which came out
  of the pit</i>, signifying the multitude which embraced that religion;
  and the <i>locusts which came out of the smoke</i>, the armies which came
  out of that multitude. This pit was opened, to let out smoke and locusts
  into the regions of the four monarchies, or some of them. <i>The King of
  these locusts</i> was the <i>Angel of the bottomless pit</i>, being chief
  governor as well in religious as civil affairs, such as was the Caliph of
  the <i>Saracens</i>. Swarms of locusts often arise in <i>Arabia
  fælix</i>, and from thence infest the neighbouring nations: and so are a
  very fit type of the numerous armies of <i>Arabians</i> invading the
  <i>Romans</i>. They began to invade them A.C. 634, and to reign at
  <i>Damascus</i> A.C. 637. They built <i>Bagdad</i> A.C. 766, and reigned
  over <i>Persia</i>, <i>Syria</i>, <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Egypt</i>,
  <i>Africa</i> and <i>Spain</i>. They afterwards lost <i>Africa</i> to
  <i>Mahades</i>, A.C. 910; <i>Media</i>, <i>Hircania</i>, <i>Chorasan</i>,
  and all <i>Persia</i>, to the <i>Dailamites</i>, between the years 927
  and 935; <i>Mesopotamia</i> and <i>Miafarekin</i> to
  <i>Nasiruddaulas</i>, A.C. 930; <i>Syria</i> and <i>Egypt</i> to
  <i>Achsjid</i>, A.C. 935, and now being in great distress, the Caliph of
  <i>Bagdad</i>, A.C. 936, surrendred all the rest of his temporal power to
  <i>Mahomet</i> the son of <i>Rajici</i>, King of <i>Wasit</i> in
  <i>Chaldea</i>, and made him Emperor of Emperors. But <i>Mahomet</i>
  within two years lost <i>Bagdad</i> to the <i>Turks</i>; and
  thenceforward <i>Bagdad</i> was sometimes in the hands of the
  <i>Turks</i>, and sometimes in the hands of the <i>Saracens</i>, till
  <i>Togrul-beig</i>, called also <i>Togra</i>, <i>Dogrissa</i>,
  <i>Tangrolipix</i>, and <i>Sadoc</i>, conquered <i>Chorasan</i> and
  <i>Persia</i>; and A.C. 1055, added <i>Bagdad</i> to his Empire, making
  it the seat thereof. His successors <i>Olub-Arflan</i> and
  <i>Melechschah</i>, conquered the regions upon <i>Euphrates</i>; and
  these conquests, after the death of <i>Melechschah</i>, brake into the
  kingdoms of <i>Armenia</i>, <i>Mesopotamia</i>, <i>Syria</i>, and
  <i>Cappadocia</i>. The whole time that the Caliphs of the <i>Saracens</i>
  reigned with a temporal dominion at <i>Damascus</i> and <i>Bagdad</i>
  together, was 300 years, <i>viz.</i> from the year 637 to the year 936
  inclusive. Now locusts live but five months; and therefore, for the
  decorum of the type, these locusts are said to <i>hurt men five months
  and five months</i>, as if they had lived about five months at
  <i>Damascus</i>, and again about five months at <i>Bagdad</i>; in all ten
  months, or 300 prophetic days, which are years.</p>

  <p>The sixth trumpet sounded to the wars, which <i>Daniel</i>'s King of
  the <i>North</i> made against the King above-mentioned, <i>who did
  according to his will</i>. In these wars the King of the <i>North</i>,
  according to <i>Daniel</i>, conquered the Empire of the <i>Greeks</i>,
  and also <i>Judea</i>, <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Lybia</i>, and <i>Ethiopia</i>:
  and by these conquests the Empire of the <i>Turks</i> was set up, as may
  be known by the extent thereof. These wars commenced A.C. 1258, when the
  four kingdoms of the <i>Turks</i> seated upon <i>Euphrates</i>, that of
  <i>Armenia major</i> seated at <i>Miyapharekin</i>, <i>Megarkin</i> or
  <i>Martyropolis</i>, that of <i>Mesopotamia</i> seated at <i>Mosul</i>,
  that of all <i>Syria</i> seated at <i>Aleppo</i>, and that of
  <i>Cappadocia</i> seated at <i>Iconium</i>, were invaded by the
  <i>Tartars</i> under <i>Hulacu</i>, and driven into the western parts of
  <i>Asia minor</i>, where they made war upon the <i>Greeks</i>, and began
  to erect the present Empire of the <i>Turks</i>. Upon the sounding of the
  sixth trumpet, <a name="NtpJohIII_9"
  href="#NtJohIII_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> <i>John heard a voice from the four
  horns of the golden Altar which is before God, saying to the sixth Angel
  which had the trumpet, Loose the four Angels which are bound at the great
  river </i>Euphrates<i>. And the four Angels were loosed, which were
  prepared for an hour and a day, and a month and a year, for to slay the
  third part of men</i>. By the four horns of the golden Altar, is
  signified the situation of the head cities of the said four kingdoms,
  <i>Miyapharekin</i>, <i>Mosul</i>, <i>Aleppo</i>, and <i>Iconium</i>,
  which were in a quadrangle. They slew the third part of men, when they
  conquered the <i>Greek</i> Empire, and took <i>Constantinople</i>, A.C.
  1453. and they began to be prepared for this purpose, when
  <i>Olub-Arslan</i> began to conquer the nations upon <i>Euphrates</i>,
  A.C. 1063. The interval is called an hour and a day, and a month and a
  year, or 391 prophetic days, which are years. In the first thirty years,
  <i>Olub-Arslan</i> and <i>Melechschah</i> conquered the nations upon
  <i>Euphrates</i>, and reigned over the whole. <i>Melechschah</i> died

  <p><i>And none was found worthy to open the book</i> till the Lamb of God
  appeared; the great High-Priest represented by a lamb slain at the foot
  of the Altar in the morning-sacrifice. <i>And he came, and took the book
  out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne.</i> For the High-Priest,
  in the feast of the seventh month, went into the most holy place, and
  took the book of the law out of the right side of the Ark, to read it to
  the people: and in order to read it well, he studied it seven days, that
  is, upon the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth days,
  being attended by some of the priests to hear him perform. These seven
  days are alluded to, by the Lamb's opening the seven seals
  successively.</p>

  <p>Upon the tenth day of the month, a young bullock was offered for a
  sin-offering for the High-Priest, and a goat for a sin-offering for the
  people: and lots were cast upon two goats to determine which of them
  should be God's lot for the sin-offering; and the other goat was called
  <i>Azazel</i>, the scape-goat. The High-Priest in his linen garments,
  took a censer full of burning coals of fire from the Altar, his hand
  being full of sweet incense beaten small; and went into the most holy
  place within the veil, and put the incense upon the fire, and sprinkled
  the blood of the bullock with his finger upon the mercy-seat and before
  the mercy-seat seven times; and then he killed the goat which fell to
  God's lot, for a sin-offering for the people, and brought his blood
  within the veil, and sprinkled it also seven times upon the mercy-seat
  and before the mercy-seat. Then he went out to the Altar, and sprinkled
  it also seven times with the blood of the bullock, and as often with the
  blood of the goat. After this <i>he laid both his hands upon the head of
  the live goat; and confessed over him all the iniquities of the children
  of </i>Israel<i>, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting
  them upon the head of the goat; and sent him away into the wilderness by
  the hands of a fit man: and the goat bore upon him all their iniquities
  into a land not inhabited</i>, Levit. chap. iv. &amp; chap. xvi. While
  the High-Priest was doing these things in the most holy place and at the
  Altar, the people continued at their devotion quietly and in silence.
  Then the High-Priest went into the holy place, put off his linen
  garments, and put on other garments; then came out, and sent the bullock
  and the goat of the sin-offering to be burnt without the camp, with fire
  taken in a censer from the Altar: and as the people returned home from
  the Temple, they said to one another, <i>God seal you to a good new
  year</i>.</p>

  <p>In allusion to all this, <i>when he had opened the seventh seal, there
  was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. And an Angel stood
  at the Altar having a golden Censer, and there was given unto him much
  incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all Saints, upon the
  golden Altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense
  with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's
  hand. And the Angel took the Censer, and filled it with fire of the
  Altar, and cast it to the earth</i>, suppose without the camp, for
  sacrificing the goat which fell to God's lot. For the High-Priest being
  <i>Christ</i> himself, the bullock is omitted. At this sacrifice <i>there
  were voices and thundrings</i>, of the musick of the Temple, <i>and
  lightnings</i> of the sacred fire, <i>and an earthquake</i>: and
  synchronal to these things was the sealing of <i>the 144000 out of all
  the twelve tribes of the children of </i>Israel<i> with the seal of God
  in their foreheads</i>, while the rest of the twelve tribes received the
  mark of the Beast, and the Woman fled from the Temple into the wilderness
  to her place upon this Beast. For this sealing and marking was
  represented by casting lots upon the two goats, sacrificing God's lot on
  mount <i>Sion</i>, and sending the scape-goat into the wilderness loaden
  with the sins of the people.</p>

  <p>Upon the fifteenth day of the month, and the six following days, there
  were very great sacrifices. And in allusion to the sounding of trumpets,
  and singing with thundring voices, and pouring out drink-offerings at
  those sacrifices, <i>seven trumpets are sounded</i>, and <i>seven
  thunders utter their voices</i>, and <i>seven vials of wrath are poured
  out</i>. Wherefore the sounding of the <i>seven trumpets</i>, the voices
  of the <i>seven thunders</i>, and the pouring out of the <i>seven vials
  of wrath</i>, are synchronal, and relate to one and the same division of
  the time of the seventh seal following the silence, into seven successive
  parts. The seven days of this feast were called the feast of Tabernacles;
  and during these seven days the children of <i>Israel</i> dwelt in
  booths, and rejoiced with palm-branches in their hands. To this alludes
  <i>the multitude with palms in their hands</i>, which appeared after the
  sealing of the 144000, and <i>came out of the great tribulation</i> with
  triumph at the battle of the great day, to which the seventh trumpet
  sounds. The visions therefore of the 144000, and of the palm-bearing
  multitude, extend to the sounding of the seventh trumpet, and therefore
  are synchronal to the times of the seventh seal.</p>

  <p>When the 144000 <i>are sealed out of all the twelve tribes of
  </i>Israel, and the rest receive <i>the mark of the Beast</i>, and
  thereby the first temple is destroyed; <i>John</i> is bidden to
  <i>measure the temple and altar</i>, that is, their courts, <i>and them
  that worship therein</i>, that is, the 144000 standing on mount
  <i>Sion</i> and on the sea of glass: <i>but the court that is without the
  temple</i>, that is, the peoples court, to <i>leave out and measure it
  not, because it is given to the</i> Gentiles, those who receive the mark
  of the Beast; <i>and the holy city they shall tread under foot forty and
  two months</i>, that is, all the time that the Beast acts under the woman
  <i>Babylon</i>: and <i>the two witnesses prophesy 1260 days</i>, that is,
  all the same time, <i>clothed in sackcloth. These have power</i>, like
  <i>Elijah, to shut heaven that it rain not</i>, at the sounding of the
  first trumpet; and, like <i>Moses, to turn the waters into blood</i> at
  the sounding of the second; <i>and to smite the earth with all
  plagues</i>, those of the trumpets, <i>as often as they will</i>. These
  prophesy at the building of the second temple, like <i>Haggai</i> and
  <i>Zechary</i>. These are <i>the two Olive-trees</i>, or Churches, which
  <i>supplied the lamps with oil</i>, <i>Zech.</i> iv. These are <i>the two
  candlesticks</i>, or Churches, <i>standing before the God of the
  earth</i>. Five of the seven Churches of <i>Asia</i>, those in
  prosperity, are found fault with, and exhorted to repent, and threatned
  to be <i>removed out of their places</i>, or <i>spewed out of
  </i>Christ's<i> mouth</i>, or <i>punished with the sword of
  </i>Christ's<i> mouth, except they repent</i>: the other two, the
  Churches of <i>Smyrna</i> and <i>Philadelphia</i>, which were under
  persecution, remain in a state of persecution, to illuminate the second
  temple. When the primitive Church catholick, represented by <i>the woman
  in heaven</i>, apostatized, and became divided into two corrupt Churches,
  represented by the <i>whore of </i>Babylon and the <i>two-horned
  Beast</i>, the 144000 <i>who were sealed out of all the twelve
  tribes</i>, became the <i>two Witnesses</i>, in opposition to those two
  false Churches: and the name of <i>two Witnesses</i> once imposed,
  remains to the true Church of God in all times and places to the end of
  the Prophecy.</p>

  <p>In the interpretation of this Prophecy, <i>the woman in heaven clothed
  with the sun</i>, before she flies into the wilderness, represents the
  primitive Church catholick, illuminated with the <i>seven lamps</i> in
  the <i>seven golden candlesticks</i>, which are the <i>seven Churches</i>
  of <i>Asia</i>. The Dragon signifies the same Empire with <i>Daniel</i>'s
  He-goat in the reign of his last horn, that is, the whole <i>Roman</i>
  Empire, until it became divided into the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>
  Empires; and all the time of that division it signifies the <i>Greek</i>
  Empire alone: and the Beast is <i>Daniel</i>'s fourth Beast, that is, the
  Empire of the <i>Latins</i>. Before the division of the <i>Roman</i>
  Empire into the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> Empires, the Beast is
  included in the body of the Dragon; and from the time of that division,
  the Beast is the <i>Latin</i> Empire only. Hence the Dragon and Beast
  have the same heads and horns; but the heads are crowned upon the Dragon,
  and the horns upon the Beast. The horns are ten kingdoms, into which the
  Beast becomes divided presently after his separation from the Dragon, as
  hath been described above. The heads are seven successive dynasties, or
  parts, into which the <i>Roman</i> Empire becomes divided by the opening
  of the seven seals. Before the woman fled into the wilderness, <i>she
  being with child</i> of a Christian Empire, <i>cried travelling</i>,
  <i>viz.</i> in the ten years persecution of <i>Dioclesian</i>, <i>and
  pained to be delivered: and the Dragon</i>, the heathen <i>Roman</i>
  Empire, <i>stood before her, to devour her child as soon as it was born.
  And she brought forth a man child, who</i> at length <i>was to rule all
  nations with a rod of iron. And her child was caught up unto God, and to
  his throne</i> in the Temple, by the victory of <i>Constantine</i> the
  great over <i>Maxentius</i>: <i>and the woman fled</i> from the Temple
  <i>into the wilderness</i> of <i>Arabia</i> to <i>Babylon</i>, <i>where
  she hath a place</i> of riches and honour and dominion, upon the back of
  the Beast, <i>prepared of God, that they should feed her there 1260 days.
  And there was war in heaven</i>, between the heathens under
  <i>Maximinus</i> and the new Christian Empire; <i>and the great Dragon
  was cast out, that old serpent, which deceiveth the whole world</i>, the
  spirit of heathen idolatry; <i>he was cast out</i> of the throne <i>into
  the earth. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
  word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the
  death</i>.</p>

  <p><i>And when the Dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
  persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child</i>, stirring up a
  new persecution against her in the reign of <i>Licinius</i>. <i>And to
  the woman</i>, by the building of <i>Constantinople</i> and equalling it
  to <i>Rome</i>, <i>were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might
  flee into the wilderness into her place</i> upon the back of her Beast,
  <i>where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from
  the face of the serpent. And the serpent</i>, upon the death of
  <i>Constantine</i> the great, <i>cast out of his mouth water as a
  flood</i>, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Western</i> Empire under <i>Constantine
  junior</i> and <i>Constans</i>, <i>after the woman: that he might cause
  her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth</i>, the nations of
  <i>Asia</i> now under <i>Constantinople</i>, <i>helped the woman</i>; and
  by conquering the <i>Western</i> Empire, now under <i>Magnentius</i>,
  <i>swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth. And the
  Dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of
  her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of
  </i>Jesus Christ<i>, which</i> in that war <i>were sealed out of all the
  twelve tribes of </i>Israel, and remained upon mount <i>Sion</i> with the
  Lamb, being in number 144000, and having their father's name written in
  their foreheads.</p>

  <p>When the earth had swallowed up the flood, and the Dragon was gone to
  make war with the remnant of the woman's seed, <i>John stood upon the
  sand of the sea, and saw a Beast rise out of the sea, having seven heads
  and ten horns. And the Beast was like unto a Leopard, and his feet were
  as the feet of a Bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lion.</i>
  <i>John</i> here names <i>Daniel</i>'s four Beasts in order, putting his
  Beast in the room of <i>Daniel</i>'s fourth Beast, to shew that they are
  the same. <i>And the Dragon gave</i> this Beast <i>his power and his seat
  and great authority</i>, by relinquishing the <i>Western</i> Empire to
  him. <i>And one of his heads</i>, the sixth, was <i>as it were wounded to
  death</i>, <i>viz.</i> by the sword of the earth, which swallowed up the
  waters cast out of the mouth of the Dragon; <i>and his deadly wound was
  healed</i>, by a new division of the Empire between <i>Valentinian</i>
  and <i>Valens</i>, <i>An.</i> 364. <i>John</i> saw the Beast rise out of
  the sea, at the division thereof between <i>Gratian</i> and
  <i>Theodosius</i>, <i>An.</i> 379. The Dragon gave the Beast his power,
  and his seat and great authority, at the death of <i>Theodosius</i>, when
  <i>Theodosius</i> gave the <i>Western</i> Empire to his son
  <i>Honorius</i>. After which the two Empires were no more united: but the
  <i>Western</i> Empire became presently divided into ten kingdoms, as
  above; and these kingdoms at length united in religion under the woman,
  and reign with her <i>forty and two months</i>.</p>

  <p><i>And I beheld</i>, saith <i>John</i>, <i>another Beast coming up out
  of the earth.</i> When the woman fled from the Dragon into the kingdom of
  the Beast, and became his Church, this other Beast rose up out of the
  earth, to represent the Church of the Dragon. For <i>he had two horns
  like the Lamb</i>, such as were the bishopricks of <i>Alexandria</i> and
  <i>Antioch</i>: <i>and he spake as the Dragon</i> in matters of religion:
  <i>and he causeth the earth</i>, or nations of the Dragon's kingdom,
  <i>to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was healed</i>, that
  is, to be of his religion. <i>And he doth great wonders, so that he
  maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men</i>;
  that is, he excommunicateth those who differ from him in point of
  religion: for in pronouncing their excommunications, they used to swing
  down a lighted torch from above. <i>And he said to them that dwell on the
  earth, that they should make an image to the Beast, which had the wound
  by a sword, and did live</i>; that is, that they should call a Council of
  men of the religion of this Beast. <i>And he had power to give life unto
  the image of the Beast, that the image of the Beast should both speak,
  and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should
  be killed</i>, <i>viz.</i> mystically, by dissolving their Churches.
  <i>And he causeth all both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,
  to receive a mark in their right band or in their foreheads, and that no
  man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the
  Beast, or the number of his name</i>; that is, the mark <img
  src="images/cross.png" alt="Cross" />, or the name <span lang="el"
  title="LATEINOS"
  >&#x39B;&#x391;&#x3A4;&#x395;&#x399;&#x39D;&#x39F;&#x3A3;</span>, or the
  number thereof <span lang="el" title="chxs"
  >&#x3C7;&#x3BE;&#x3C2;</span>, 666. All others were excommunicated.</p>

  <p>When the seven Angels had poured out the seven vials of wrath, and
  <i>John</i> had described them all in the present time, he is called up
  from the time of the seventh vial to the time of the sixth seal, to take
  a view of the woman and her Beast, who were to reign in the times of the
  seventh seal. In respect of the latter part of time of the sixth seal,
  then considered as present, the Angel tells <i>John</i>: <i>The Beast
  that thou sawest, was and is not, and shall ascend out of the abyss, and
  go into perdition</i>; that is, he was in the reign of <i>Constans</i>
  and <i>Magnentius</i>, until <i>Constantius</i> conquered
  <i>Magnentius</i>, and re-united the <i>Western</i> Empire to the
  <i>Eastern</i>. He is not during the reunion, and he shall ascend out of
  the abyss or sea at a following division of the Empire. The Angel tells
  him further: <i>Here is the mind which hath wisdom: the seven heads are
  seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth</i>; <i>Rome</i> being built
  upon seven hills, and thence called the seven-hilled city. <i>Also there
  are seven Kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet
  come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space: and the Beast
  that was and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and
  goeth into perdition</i>. Five are fallen, the times of the five first
  seals being past; and one is, the time of the sixth seal being considered
  as present; and another is not yet come, and when he cometh, which will
  be at the opening of the seventh seal, he must continue a short space:
  and the Beast that was and is not, even he is the eighth, by means of the
  division of the <i>Roman</i> Empire into two collateral Empires; and is
  of the seven, being one half of the seventh, and shall go into perdition.
  The words, <i>five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet
  come</i>, are usually referred by interpreters to the time of <i>John</i>
  the Apostle, when the Prophecy was given: but it is to be considered,
  that in this Prophecy many things are spoken of as present, which were
  not present when the Prophecy was given, but which would be present with
  respect to some future time, considered as present in the visions. Thus
  where it is said upon pouring out the seventh vial of wrath, that
  <i>great </i>Babylon<i> came in remembrance before God, to give unto her
  the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath</i>; this relates not
  to the time of <i>John</i> the Apostle, but to the time of pouring out
  the seventh vial of wrath. So where it is said, <i>Babylon is fallen, is
  fallen</i>; and <i>thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come
  for thee to reap</i>; and <i>the time of the dead is come, that they
  should be judged</i>; and again, <i>I saw the dead small and great stand
  before God</i>: these sayings relate not to the days of <i>John</i> the
  Apostle, but to the latter times considered as present in the visions. In
  like manner the words, <i>five are fallen, and one is, and the other is
  not yet come</i>, and <i>the Beast that was and is not, he is the
  eighth</i>, are not to be referred to the age of <i>John</i> the Apostle,
  but relate to the time when the Beast was to be wounded to death with a
  sword, and shew that this wound was to be given him in his sixth head:
  and without this reference we are not told in what head the Beast was
  wounded. <i>And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten Kings, which
  have received no kingdom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with
  the Beast. These have one mind</i>, being all of the whore's religion,
  <i>and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast. These shall
  make war with the Lamb</i>, at the sounding of the seventh trumpet;
  <i>and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of Lords and King of
  Kings; and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful. And
  he saith unto me, the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth,
  are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues</i>, composing her
  Beast. <i>And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the Beast, these shall
  hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her
  flesh, and burn her with fire</i>, at the end of the 1260 days. <i>For
  God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree and give
  their kingdom unto the Beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
  And the woman which thou sawest, is that great city which reigneth over
  the Kings of the earth</i>, or the great city of the <i>Latins</i>, which
  reigneth over the ten Kings till the end of those days.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
